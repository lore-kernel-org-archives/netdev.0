Here we can have various kernel versions which is not much different. I=

But when it gets into mainline people should be able to write applicati=
ons=20
that will be forward and backward compatible (as far as possible) with=20
various kernel versions.

Sure it would be nice to have applications that use this interface. But=
 in my=20
opinion the basic interface is not yet ready to be included in mainline=
=20
applications. It especially lacks features that will allow application=20
developers to maintain compatibility.

That's why I'm trying to finish the qpolicy framework. Without providin=
g=20
runtime information it will turn out that application developers will b=
e=20
afraid to use new features just because the application won't be able t=
o=20
check if given parameter is supported or not.

I understand that there might be some missing features in DCCP that are=
 more=20
important than yet another informational getsockopt. But these features=
 are=20
IMO highly independent and can be developed in parallel.

I don't like the "highest supported ID" approach. But if you don't like=
 arrays=20
a simple "bool getsockopt" would do, we could just ask the kernel if it=
=20
supports given qpolicy. Like (in pseudocode):
bool supports_prio=3Dgetsockopt(sk,DCCP_SOCKOPT_QPOLICY_AVAILABLE,QPOLI=
CY_PRIO);
Would that be ok?

Can you guarantee that nobody ever will add a parameter? In fact even t=
oday I=20
can think of two parameters that could be added: the previously discuss=
ed=20
timeout and my new concept - the identity or category parameter (which =
is a=20
subject for a separate thread).

BTW, the somewhat big code was meant to act as a framework for other fe=
atures.=20
Like getting information about percent of dropped packets in prio qpoli=
cy=20
queue.
