I suggest doing absolutely nothing: do what you originally proposed,
which is to report the EAGAIN so that the client state machine retries
the socket write.

My point is that this is a context which is _not_ atomic with the
original report of tcp window/buffer space congestion. There are no
locks or anything else that will guarantee that the congestion still
exists, and the fact that the SOCK_ASYNC_NOSPACE flag is now clear
indicates that this is the case.
The whole purpose of xs_nospace() is to wait until a congestion
condition clears. If the congestion clears before we get here, then we
have no reason to do anything special other than retry.
