I mean the latter.  We do this in other subsystems, such as
IPSEC, for various hashes.

You only increase, never decrease.

A lock is held during every access to these hash tables, so
the locking should be very similar.

Have a look at xfrm_hash_resize() in net/xfrm/xfrm_state.c to get
a good idea on how this stuff can be done.  And hey, that code
resizes 3 tables at once, you only need to handle one :)
