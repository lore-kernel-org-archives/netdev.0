Having IPoIB check for all of these and fail to start if not supported is good.
But the suggestion before was to have "cap_ipoib".  I don't think we want that.

Right.

Because only those 2 support the list of capabilities above.

Fair enough but IPoIB does need to check for SA support now as well as IB
addressing which is currently IB Link Layer (although as Doug said the Port and
Address format go hand in hand.  So I'm happy calling it whatever.)

For your hypothetical case, agreed.  But I want to make it clear for those who
may be casually reading this thread that OPA addresses are IB addresses right
now.

Agreed.
