Hi Sven,

this looks good to me. I have confirmed that it applies against lvs-2.6
(but not net-2.6 as changes that are already in lvs-2.6 are needed).

One minor style question.  You have changed struct ip_vs_lblc_table to *tbl
in several places, (e.g. sizeof(*tbl) ). I think that I prefer things the
way that they were. Was there a reason for this change?
