This fixes a problem and a potential loophole with regard to seqno/ackno
validity: currently the initial adjustments to AWL/SWL are only performed
once at the begin of the connection, during the handshake.

Since the Sequence Window feature is always greater than Wmin=32 (7.5.2),
it is however necessary to perform these adjustments at least for the first
W/W' (variables as per 7.5.1) packets in the lifetime of a connection.

This requirement is complicated by the fact that W/W' can change at any time
during the lifetime of a connection.

Therefore it is better to perform that safety check each time SWL/AWL are
updated, as implemented by the patch.

A second problem solved by this patch is that the remote/local Sequence Window
feature values (which set the bounds for AWL/SWL/SWH) are undefined until the
feature negotiation has completed.

During the initial handshake we have more stringent sequence number protection;
the changes added by this patch effect that {A,S}W{L,H} are within the correct
bounds at the instant that feature negotiation completes (since the SeqWin
feature activation handlers call dccp_update_gsr/gss()).
