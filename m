After extensive testing by Julius Volz and limited testing by myself, I
have applied the first patch, which does indeed allow packets with
PARTIAL_CHECKSUM to work, to lvs-next-2.6. I have dropped the second two
patches which produce bogus checksums.

I will revisit the second to patches at some point and try and produce
versions that work.
