Is there a pathological case here if sysctl_ip_vs_lblc_expiration is
set to be very short and we happen to hit ip_vs_lblc_full_check()?

To be honest I think that I like the reference count approach best,
as it seems safe and simple. Is it really going to be horrible
for performance?

If so, I wonder if a workable solution would be to provide a more fine-grained
lock on tbl. Something like the way that ct_read_lock/unlock() works.
