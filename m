Trust me: I spent several weeks debugging this particular problem :)
(See the PS for a somewhat lengthy description of what I remember)

Duh... I forgot that the XID was still global...

Does anybody see any problems with moving the XID counter into the struct
xprt? Please bear in mind that the replay caches on modern NFS servers
look at XID+client IP address+port number, so 2 sockets that play the sam=
e
XID to the server should not normally conflict.

had a BKL removal patch in their SLES8 kernel, and I spent a total of

I totally agree with this...

No extra work has been done on BKL removal in the 2.6 branch, and I know
that the old patch that was up for testing in the 2.4 tree was buggy in
several ways...

Yep, but there is only one inode per dentry, and the VFS rules forbids yo=
u
to convert a negative dentry into a positive one (the contrary is allowed=
,
but only under certain restricted situations).

removing stuff from the nfs_deletes list. The reference counting on
nfs_unlinkdata isn't atomic either.

Sure... The unlink.c global lists definitely depend on the BKL for
protection. The latter would need to be replaced by a new global
spinlock.
