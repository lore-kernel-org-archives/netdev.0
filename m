Ok, then we will just keep the old one in parallel for some time.

Ah, that's what I thought... Are there any simple kernel examples with
userspace counterparts to look at? I know iproute2 uses netlink, but

Genetlink seems especially nice, although I couldn't find a general
explanation of it other than in git history.
