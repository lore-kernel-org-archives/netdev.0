Hi Hans,

thanks for your work on this.
I've looked over the patches and nothing catches my eye -
thanks for fixing up the things that I commented on previously.

I think that patches 1 and 2 should be targeted at 2.6.39,
while the remainder look like 2.6.40 material. Does that
sound reasonable to you?

Julian and Eric,

can you take a look over these?
I would appreciate your review.
