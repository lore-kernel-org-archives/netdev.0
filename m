So the NFSv4 backchannel isn't handled for now, I assume.  And I guess
NFSv2/v3 is out too thanks to rpcbind?  Which maybe is fine.

Do we need an IETF draft or similar to document how NFS should work over
AF_VSOCK?

NFS developers rely heavily on wireshark (and similar tools) for
debugging.  Is that still possible over AF_VSOCK?

So by a netcat-like utility, you mean it's proxying between client and a
server so the client thinks the server is communicating over AF_VSOCK
and the server thinks the client is using TCP?  (Sorry, I haven't looked
at the code.)

Once we have a server and client, how will you recommend testing them?
(Will the server side need to run on real hardware?)

I guess if it works then the main question is whether it's worth
supporting another transport type in order to get the zero-configuration
host<->guest NFS setup.  Or whether there's another way to get the same
gains.

Seems like a useful thing to have.
