ihl is still used for the length of the first IP header in the skb.
The struct "ip_vs_iphdr ciph" is only used later, for the embedded IP
header in the ICMP packet. It's needed because pp->conn_out_get()
expects a pointer to this struct as a parameter. I hope that makes
sense or did I miss something?

I'll answer this below:

I followed the same structure as in the v4 version of ip_vs_out_icmp()
here. I think this might be needed because ip_vs_gather_frags{_v6}
changes the location of the IP header in the skb during reassembly?
