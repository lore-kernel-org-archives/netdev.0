Hi Dave,

please find the first set summarised below.


This is the first set of the feature negotiation patches. These provide a 
self-contained feature negotiation API for the DCCP protocol (RFC 4340-2).

The whole set is structured into 3 main blocks - (1) basis, (2) core,
(3) integration and cleanup. Within these blocks, this is the first,
self-contained, set and its purpose is to provide
 (a) the underlying datastructures
 (b) initialisation and cleanup routines for the new datastructures.

List of patches in this set:
----------------------------
Patch #1: Provides the basic datastructure for feature negotiation. It gets 
          around the problem that feature-negotiation values have no uniform
	  type - they can be 48-bit numbers, single characters, 2-byte integers
	  or a list of unsigned chars.
Patch #2: Provides a lookup-table for the different negotiable features.
Patch #3: Adds list management for the list keeping the negotiation-options.
Patch #4: Initialisation routines (for request sockets and normal sockets).
Patch #5: Analogous to #4, this provides the cleanup routines.	  


The set is also available for viewing online, beginning at
