Or maybe not at all: We could pass NULL, 0, which is what has to work
anyway for the kasprintf case - failure will then be detected through a=
n
oops, but I think that should be ok. That would also remove the memset =
and
memchr_inv calls above.

I don't like the idea of just defining a small stack buffer (say
buf[16]) and passing that (still with a size of 0): It's better to
either detect writes directly (by passing a large enough buffer with
known contents), or indirectly through an oops, as opposed to having to
figure it out from random stack corruption. And kmalloc'ing+error
handling+kfree'ing a buffer inside the overflow check would just be
plain silly, when we have a large enough buffer already.

Yes, that will make the patch even smaller, just touching that single
line. Done.

I don't think we need to care. AFAICT, task_name is only used for
/proc/*/status, and it is the first thing to fill anything into the
seq_file, so overflow is impossible. [Testing for pre-existing overflow
also wouldn't be enough; one should check whether there's actually room
for ~32 bytes.]

As I said, I do think that longer-term one shouldn't have to poke aroun=
d
in the seq_file internals, but for now I'd like to make the patch minim=
al.

Well, %pT is a completely new addition to vsprintf.c. Also, I don't
think that would be a very good match - not every user of %pT might wan=
t
escaping, so at the very least this would require implementing some
extra flags for %pT. But if task_name would be the only user of those
flags, I think the escaping logic is better kept there. Anyway, this is
outside this series' scope.
