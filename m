I do not see much advantage of doing so. You may create a loop with
random number for in-size and check. So, I prefer to see separate case
for that.

Yes, too late, thus it's enough time to address my comments :-)

On the other hand I actually don't know if it's a good idea to push this
series to stable. I guess you may just put Fixes: tags in the patches
1/3, 3/3 w/o Cc'ing to stable since we have no issues with current
users.
