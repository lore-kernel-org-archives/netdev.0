	In the common case - yes. nfct_seqadj_ext_add needs
to be called before confirmation, that is why we place it
in ip_vs_update_conntrack(). There is another case when
synced connection comes to backup in established state.
I'm not sure what happens in netfilter in this case, we
do not provide any initial seq and offsets to be used by
the seqadj code. We have to think more about this case.

	So, we need nfct_seqadj check in ip_vs_ftp_out or in
nf_ct_seqadj_set as in your patch 1/2 to avoid oops for
synced connections.

	Yes. And we can not do it just before nf_nat_mangle_tcp_packet,
it should happen before conntrack is confirmed, on SYN.

	It is only for UDP, for now...
