Looking at the code it doesn't seem that simple. We lock __ip_vs_svc_lock 
for writing and then wait for all current users of the service to go away. 
But it's still possible that we clean up destinations from other services. 
And when we restrict it to only clean up the destinations that match our 
service, we have a chance of leaving destinations in the trash for good.
