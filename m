Sorry, I forgot to finish this sentance :-(

What I was thinking was that any change would introduce a
protocol incompatibility. However I think that there is
some room for small changes to be added using currently unsued
bits in ip_vs_sync_conn.flags. This could also be used to
allow syncryonising of timeouts (which is unrelated to IPv6).

So while my general feeling that the synchronisation protocol
is not as extendable as it should be stands. We can probably
work with the current protocol for now.
