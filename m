	This check (now flag ipvs_property) was implemented to avoid
netfilter to modify packet which was already changed by IPVS.
What happened was that FTP commands (TCP header and payload) were
modified first by ip_vs_ftp and then by netfilter. The result:
packet with wrong SEQ number. Later, after some Netfilter 
changes (2.6.11), TCP payload was modified always in POST_ROUTING
while address can be  modified in PRE_ROUTING. Not sure what happens
now, Netfilter code was reorganized and new code review and tests
are needed, may be such double manipulation (if ipvs_property is
not set) still can cause problems.
