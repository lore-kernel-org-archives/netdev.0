[DCCP]: Registration routines for changing feature values

[DCCP]: Implement both feature-local and feature-remote Sequence Window feature

==> Removed the default initialisation of the Sequence Window feature value.
    This is redundant, a better solution is implemented in subsequent patch set.
==> Also calls the Sequence Window handlers immediately, so that the sequence
    and acknowledgment validity windows are updated.

[DCCP]: Support exchange of NN options in (PART)OPEN state

==> Lifted the restriction to exchanging only Ack Ratio options, since Sequence
    Window values also need to be updated in established state.
    Patches to actually do this for CCID2 are work in progress.

[ACKVEC]: Update Ack Vector input routine

==> Added a "cope with large bursts" recovery hook as follows:

  When a packet is missing, the Ack Vector code normally reserves one entry. This
  causes problems with larger losses, since the space requirements are O(burst_length).
  
  This patch defines a threshold for bursty loss, when exceeding this threshold,
  Ack Vector cells are populated up to their limit, without the expensive space
  reservation. 
  
  The advantage of this strategy is to reduce Ack Vector length under heavier loss
  conditions.
