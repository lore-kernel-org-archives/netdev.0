As expected I do not seem able to trigger the null-pointer exception
with the patch applied to 2.6.38-rc6. The patch does not apply to the
2.6.37 kernel I was using, but only moving to closed-state check does the
trick.

May I suggest separating the closed-state-check fix into a patch of
its own which could be marked for stable and more easily backported as
it fixes a pretty severe bug?

Below are the bits that fixed the issue on 2.6.37. Perhaps this along
with a more detailed description of the error, including the panic
message, could serve as the basis for such a patch?

Feel free to add
