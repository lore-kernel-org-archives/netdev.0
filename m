	There is still a problem when RIP and VIP differ in
text length because now ack_seq sent to RIP is not
adjusted after receiving the the 227 Entering Passive Mode
reply. I tried also to set *diff, ack_seq was corrected
but the result was bad checksum.

	Agreed, lets try nfct_seqadj_ext_add() + nf_ct_seqadj_init()
if nfct_seqadj(ct) is NULL.
