If inet{,6}_skb_parm is used only outside DCCP code then why at all sho=
uld it=20
be placed in struct dccp_skb_cb taking up quite a lot of valuable space=
? Why=20
not put it directly in struct sk_buff? Especially that it is present in=
=20
struct udp_skb_cb, struct tcp_skb_cb as well.

You can never assume that the API is feature complete. Even if it "work=
s half"=20
at the beginning (which is I guess quite normal) it should be easy to m=
ake=20
it "work full" without breaking compatibility when it's not necessary.

I don't have any 64 bit system at hand...
Does David's suggestion mean that changes are only required in userspac=
e=20
application or on the kernel side as well?

Yes, it can be achieved by bit operations. But to me a structure is a m=
uch=20
cleaner way. And that is especially important when designing interfaces=
=2E=20
=46inal effects should be the same but when using structure it is the c=
ompiler=20
that takes care of low level bit operations.

Ok, for now 32 bits are enough and I can't think of the need to use mor=
e bits.=20
I wouldn't be so sure about future though. But ok, if it turns up that =
we=20
need more space in the future then we will see, there is no need to wor=
ry=20
about it now. We can indeed assume 32 bits for now.
