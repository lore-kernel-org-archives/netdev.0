I apologize if my request for "English" seemed Anglo-centric.  What I =20
intended was "non-machine-generated" and expressed in the natural =20
language that is usual for Linux kernel patch descriptions, which =20
appears to be English.

Not being a maintainer myself, I can't enforce any requirement here.  =20
I was simply suggesting ways to help the patch make its way =20
expediently to reviewers and people who can get it into the kernel.

I agree with you that the diff output in the patch description was =20
confusing, and yes, after Dave's first comment I understood what the =20
description meant.  I believe patch authors owe it to maintainers, who =
=20
have dozens of patches to review a day, to keep it as simple and easy =20
as possible.  I have tried to work with individual maintainers where =20
possible to improve the legibility of my patches, though at times I =20
have fallen short.

Although interesting, the tool output doesn't seem necessary to =20
justify the proposed change.  A single sentence, as Trond suggested, =20
would have been far more concise.  And Bruce's recommendations for =20
setting off machine-generated content in a patch description are cogent=
=2E

In addition to crafting a legible description, my suggestions were =20
about cc'ing the proper mailing list, and routing this patch directly =20
to the sunrpc kernel maintainers in the first place, all of which are =20
listed within easy reach in MAINTAINERS.  A handful of us on linux-nfs =
=20
happen to read netdev, but not all of us.  We do try to stick to a =20
fair review process here, which includes archiving the patch and =20
reviewer comments via linux-nfs-u79uwXL29TaiAVqoAR/hOA@public.gmane.org

J. Bruce Fields continues:
> Anyway, the patch looks obviously fine to me[.]

I don't have an immediate problem with the patch's content either, as =20
long as it has been tested and does not introduce any new sparse or =20
compiler warnings.  I'm all for the intelligent elimination of gotos =20
and duplicated code.

But I wonder how we ended up with these two copies of the same logic.  =
=20
It may be that at some point in the past we had more different logic =20
in the two write_space functions, but I suppose we can split it out =20
again if we ever need to.  Thinking aloud, at some point we may have =20
lost a little history here, or we may have perhaps lost any implicit =20
operational dependencies on other parts of xprtsock.c (like the TCP =20
state logic) that are not expressed in the source code or comments.

The newly shared code appears to be socket-specific, so it does not =20
belong in the shared function we already have, xprt_write_space(), =20
which is meant to be transport-generic.
