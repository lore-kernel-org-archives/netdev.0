Hi Joe,

Hm, ok. This patch doesn't touch any functionality though. It only
moves files from one directory to another, so it's merely cosmetics,
no IPv6 knowledge required. Of course, we could still do the move
later, after some IPv6 code is actually in IPVS. If there is no
reaction, I'll just continue working under net/ipv4/ipvs for now. No
big deal.

Thank you! Good to have interested people for testing later on. We
also have some, but different people and organizations have different
setups and edge cases to help testing.

The other code I have at the moment compiles (sometimes), but doesn't
do much more. It needs much more work to actually do something again
with either IP version.

Yes, he and his code seem to have disappeared...

Yes! :)

Ok, thanks. Let me know in case you stumble over it!

Yes, once there is code that does something useful! At the moment, it
seems like a hamburger too big to get a good first bite at. But I'm
working on it...

Thanks for responding once again, Joe!
