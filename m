I'm OK with that.  In the original patch, I think both were somewhat =20
difficult to parse.  My request is to try harder next time to make =20
them clear.  It sounds like we agree here.

Like all things software, absolute statements are usually always =20
proven incorrect (eg "goto is spawn of the devil and should never be =20
used").  Code duplication is _usually_ bad.  Sometimes there is a =20
reason for it.  We want to avoid a knee-jerk response of eliminating =20
it wherever we find it, without another thought.

It can.  But it's interesting to observe that the point of your =20
proposed change was to reduce lines of code and code obscurity.  Your =20
description, however, was much longer and more obscure than it needed =20
to be.  :-)

I was too harsh to ask for no machine-generated patch descriptions.  =20
The point is, is the description meaningful and concise?

Verification of your patch is different than justification.  But =20
that's a minor point.

Yes, we should fix the SUNRPC entries in MAINTAINERS.

My experience is usually the opposite.  I post a patch directly to a =20
maintainer and get a "please use such-and-such list" response.  The =20
exception is usually very specific device drivers.

But you're right, it would be nice to have some consistency here =20
across the kernel.

My concern with immediately accepting a patch that appears to be =20
solely machine-generated is exactly this.  The submission didn't leave =
=20
me with the impression that there was a human who had taken the time =20
to understand history (git log/annotate) and how the code works, what =20
the source code was attempting to express, or whether the resulting =20
patch was even tested.  Usually you can glean a bit of this from a =20
lengthier patch description.

Yes, yours was a simple and proper change in the end, but still.  =20
Given the long "dialog" just had on lkml about compiler (machine-=20
generated) optimizations, I think we would all be just a little =20
skeptical (or perhaps careful) about such automated transformations.

You are correct, the analysis doesn't change anything, but the =20
analysis is worth at least noting during review.  It helps us =20
understand where we have to make the code more clear.

The question is whether the code itself documents dependencies on =20
other parts of the code, whether such dependencies are only documented =
=20
by comments, or whether it is entirely implicit and up to the folks =20
who work on it to understand and remember. This is usually only an =20
issue when someone who has never worked on the code submits a patch.

The goal of open source code is to facilitate other folks modifying =20
our code.  For open source especially it is a larger issue than simple =
=20
code maintenance.  It is not enough for open source code simply to =20
work.  If people outside our team (or outside the larger Linux =20
community) can't easily understand the important features of our open =20
source code, then we've still failed, even if the legal barriers have =20
been lifted by the GPL.

Thus I'm especially sensitive to areas where our source code does not =20
express itself well to folks who are not familiar.  We want to invite =20
wider review, and that's simply not possible if nobody understands =20
this code base but ourselves.
