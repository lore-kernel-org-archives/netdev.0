I have to apologise here -- this was my oversight. The bug I assumed to be there 
does not exist, since the tx_qlen was indeed part of the socket. Sorry.

| What happens if application is compiled with dccp_packet_info containing only

Had not looked at it from this point of view. So you are suggesting

	if (msg->msg_control != NULL && msg->msg_controllen >= sizeof(*dcp))
		dcp = (struct dccp_packet_info *)msg->msg_control;

instead? Agreed, point #1 to change in the patch.

I can't see anything wrong with putting everything into dccp_sock. To do it well, 
we could consider inserting documentation such as "this section is only for
queueing policies" (as is done very well for struct tcp_sock).

I see several advantages of this:
 * by just storing the u8 of the policy ID, the socket as a whole gets smaller,
 * when not using nested structs, the elements can be optimised for minimal space,
 * the internals of the function pointer table can be hidden,
 * the socket carries the same information as is passed on via socket options,
   which simplifies querying.

| What about DCCP_LISTENING state?
| 
There is a problem with allowing this, considering for example:
 * socket is created, and listen() is called,
 * socket enters with default policy,
 * now user decides to change policy from default ("simple") to "prio",
 * before he can do that, the first packet arrives on the incoming
   queue, policy is inherited to child socket,
 * so this connection ends up with "simple" policy instead of "prio".

The documentation certainly needs more work, I just sketched something
but it is not very good. So this is point #2 which needs to change.

Ideally, it would have a little description of what each policy does and
for which use case it is best suited.

Please take your time and check through the other parts of the patch as
well. I would like to accumulate the issues and then address each of the
points. And also, do some testing.I haven't had time to write test code for
prio policy -- is there something in your SVN repository?
