	Can you explain, what do you mean with unreachable
destination? Are you adding some rejecting route?

> Do you have an idea why  this happens in the ipvs case ?

	Do you see with debug level 3 the "Removing destination"
messages. Only real servers can hold dest->dst_cache reference
for dev which can be a problem because the real servers are not
deleted immediately - on traffic they are moved to trash
list. But ip_vs_trash_cleanup() should remove any left
structures. You should check in debug that all servers are
deleted. If all real server structures are freed but
problem remains we should look more deeply in the
dest->dst_cache usage. DR or NAT is used?

	I assume cleanup really happens in this order:

ip_vs_cleanup():
	nf_unregister_hooks()
	...
	ip_vs_conn_cleanup()
	...
	ip_vs_control_cleanup()
