Sorry, I sent this from an environment where I didn't have the
information and just wanted to give a quick ACK on the IPVS move
decision.

The build with ARCH=um seems to have a problem with the
architecture-specific headers:

net/core/skb_dma_map.c: In function 'skb_dma_map':
net/core/skb_dma_map.c:20: error: implicit declaration of function
'dma_mapping_error'

The bad commit that introduces the skb_dma_map.c file (and this error)
is a40c24a1336. Previous versions build fine.

Linus' linux-2.6 (he doesn't have a linux-next-2.6, right?) works, but
that doesn't even contain the file that has the build problem.

Yes, I'll give a better report next time.
