Look more closely: the callers that enqueue task_cleanup on the
workqueue all ensure that XPRT_LOCKED is held, and it isn't released
until the call to xprt_release_write() at the very end of
xprt_autoclose().

The rpciod_workqueue deadlocking is an issue, though, so unfortunately,
we won't be able to make use of the above.
