> Changes in v2:
>  * rebase on top of net-next
>  * currently by default refcount_t = atomic_t (*) and uses all 
>    atomic standard operations unless CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL is enabled.
>    This is a compromise for the systems that are critical on
>    performance (such as net) and cannot accept even slight delay
>    on the refcounter operations.
> 
> This series, for various misc network components, replaces atomic_t reference
> counters with the new refcount_t type and API (see include/linux/refcount.h).
> By doing this we prevent intentional or accidental
> underflows or overflows that can led to use-after-free vulnerabilities.
> These are the last networking-related conversions with the exception of
> network drivers (to be send separately).
> 
> Please excuse the long patch set, but seems like breaking it up
> won't save that much on CC list and most of the changes are
> trivial.
> 
> The patches are fully independent and can be cherry-picked separately.
> In order to try with refcount functionality enabled in run-time,
> CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL must be enabled.
> 
> NOTE: automatic kernel builder for some reason doesn't like all my
> network branches and regularly times out the builds on these branches.
> Suggestion for "waiting a day for a good coverage" doesn't work, as
> we have seen with generic network conversions. So please wait for the
> full report from kernel test rebot before merging further up.
> This has been compile-tested in 116 configs, but 71 timed out (including
> all s390-related configs again). I am trying to see if they can fix
> build coverage for me in meanwhile.

> * The respective change is currently merged into -next as
>   "locking/refcount: Create unchecked atomic_t implementation".

Series applied, that's enough for this cycle, please.
