Hi Dave,

Sorry for not sending a pull-request for a while. There are two new
features, IPv6 and local process load balancing. Unfortunately there we=
re
some conflicts to shake out. And even more unfortunately some errors we=
re
introduced along the way. In hindsight I should have merged IPv6 first =
and
sent you that. But I think that things are in order now.

If you would like me to change my process, please just let me know.

Summary:

1) Julius Volz and Vince Busam added IPv6 support.

2) Malcolm Turnbull and Siim P=F5der added support to allow
   connections from a local process to be load balanced.

3) I merged the local process load balancing and IPv6 features.

4) Julius Volz noticed that I broke IPv6 during this merge and
   thanks to some extensive testing found a bogus call
   to ip_route_me_harder(). This was a cut-and-paste error
   on my part. Very sorry about that.

5) Julian Anastasov noted that the local process feature was
   allowing for empty TCP checksums which is not legal. After
   discussion with Herbert Xu it was determined that the problem
   was that the new code didn't handle partial checksums correctly.

   Partial checksums were previously not possible as traffic from the
   loopback device was not handled at all (can they show up other ways?=
). I
   added some code to both TCP and UDP to handle PARTIAL_CHECKSUM. Once
   again Julius Volz did a lot of work testing the solution and verifyi=
ng
   that it worked.

   I also came up with some patches to implement IPVS's checksumming in
   terms of the standard proto_csum_replace* helper functions. These
   patches produce incorrect checksums and have been put on hold for no=
w.

6) Sven Wegener provided some post-merge review of the IPv6 code
   and some cleanup patches.

7) Sven Wegener provided a patch to streamline the way that the
   connection table size is configured through Kconfig.


The following changes are available in the git repository at:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/lvs-2.6.git lvs-n=
ext-2.6

They should apply cleanly to net-next-2.6, which I pulled and merged th=
is
morning.
