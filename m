	IP_VS_WAIT_WHILE should be called because some
schedulers do not use locks for ->schedule, eg. WLC.
They rely on svc->usecnt reference to hold the virtual
service. Nothing changes now with netns. It is currently the
only way to modify or delete virtual service or scheduler.
Of course, __ip_vs_svc_lock is now global but we do not
have a choice.

	You mean, only in the planned patch, yes?

	OK, very good.
