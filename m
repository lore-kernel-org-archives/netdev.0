Thanks, I appreciate that. I think that these patches are starting
to look quite nice. I've posted some coments (all relating to style I
think) to some of the patches. Nothing else has caught my eye so far.

I've verified that these patches apply against the lvs-next-2.6 branch of
of the lvs-2.6 tree. Which means they should also apply against Dave's
net-next-2.6 tree (net-next-2.6 and lvs-next-2.6 are currently converged).
Which would seem to be the most likely target for these changes at this
time.

I'm comfortable with merging things in that state.

It seems quite reasonable to add IPv6 features in an iterative
manner so long as IPv4 keeps working.
