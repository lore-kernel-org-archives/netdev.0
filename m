If you look at my original problem report, you'll see that has nothing
to do with the problem I'm seeing.

My problem is:

- TCP disconnects
- NFS tries to establish a new connection with the server, sending a SY=
N
- NFS server replies with a SYNACK
- NFS client immediately sends another SYN with a different sequence
   number, so it's a _new_ attempt to connect to the NFS server.

At this point, the socket for the previous SYNACK'd connection has been
destroyed mid-setup.

This is because the sunrpc code is horribly racy - it doesn't block a
second attempt to call kernel_connect() on a socket which is already in
the process of connecting to the NFS server.

Even if the SYNACK had been corrupted (due to mvneta's rx code), that
has no bearing on the race in the sunrpc layer that destroys the previo=
us
socket before the TCP SYN/SYNACK/ACK handshake has had a chance to
complete.
