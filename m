Ian, please acknowledge my grievances here.  I see you replying to other
people, but not to me and I'm the one who has to process all of this
stuff eventually.

If you want this series to be taken seriously:

1) Make your patches against net-next GIT, none of your driver patches will
   apply because they have all been moved around to different locations
   under drivers/net

2) Submit this in a _SANE_ way.  This means, get the first patch that adds
   the new interfaces approved and merged.  Then slowly and carefuly submit
   small, reasonably sized, sets of patches that convert the drivers over.

Otherwise there is no way I'm even looking at this stuff, let alone actually
apply it.

Realize that every time you patch bomb rediculiously like this I have
to click and classify every single patch in your bomb at
