Let me remind you your comment made on 18/03/2008 on dccp ml to my firs=

I think this should be just one field for the policy, and the
policy_data can be an internal field of `struct queueing_policy'
(compare with struct ackvec or struct ccid).

I have nothing against it. In fact that's what I did in the first try.

Ok, you are right. If before DCCP_LISTENING there is always DCCP_CLOSED=
 then=20
there is no need to allow changing qpolicy in DCCP_LISTENING state.

One more question (probably more for Arnaldo): is there any timeframe t=
