Thanks for wading through this!

Yes, that looks nicer and more like the other cases!

Right, thanks!

No, the buffer can receive several strings (but it's limited in size,
so you have to be careful). An index to the current position in the
buffer is maintained in the 'idx' variable between multiple
IP_VS_DBG_ADDR calls used in the same outer macro.

In general, I'm a bit unsure if this kind of macro magic is acceptable
style, but it was the best way I could come up with to merge
alternating v4 and v6 output without too much code duplication.

Good catch! No, I wasn't even aware of that feature in the new ipvsadm
(but now I see it). I think it should be removed because it is
effectively dead code (the existing v4 proc format shouldn't be
changed). Vince, do you agree?

Yes, it's nicer this way around, I'll change that!

Yes, I have found no nice way to achieve this yet :( At least not when
reworking the complete end result (one big patch) into smaller
patches, because there is so much interdependency and several logical
changes within the same hunks (or even lines). I might have to
manually do a step-by-step adding of the logical code features to get
this... I will try to work on that next.

> * Where possible please make lines <= 80 columns wide

Yes, I will check for that more strictly now (unless it really looks
nicer otherwise), thanks!
