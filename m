To summarize, you are running late model 2.6 kernels on a NAS =20
appliance, and your 2.4 clients are having trouble using large rsize =20
and wsize.

Even with NFS/TCP ?  Oh, I see -- the clients are 10Mbit half-duplex.

Any relevant messages in the kernel log on either the client or server?

You could try capturing a raw packet trace of the initial mount and a =20
few reads and write on the share.  The clients negotiate the rsize and =
=20
wsize settings with the server, and the packet dump would expose the =20
negotiated values.

On your clients, use "tcpdump -s 0 -w /tmp/raw host" followed by the =20
DNS name of your server.  Then attach the raw pcap files to e-mail (as =
=20
long as they are less than 100KB or so) and post them to linux-nfs@vger=
=2Ekernel.org=20
=2E
