NFS does this because this is how we initially "fixed" it to not block
the freezer. It sucks and is prone to deadlocking if you selectively
freeze processes via the cgroup freezer. It does basically "work" in
most cases though if the freezer is running to suspend the whole system.

I'm looking at fixing this by instead setting points within the NFS/RPC
layers that cause these calls to return something like ERESTARTSYS
instead when a freeze event comes in, depending on whether a call has
already been transmitted to the server.

That's likely to take a while though, and in the meantime we don't want
lockdep complaining every time someone fires off a RPC call with locks
held. So for now, we'd like to "opt out" of these lockdep warnings.
