Hi Patrick,

could you take a moment to look at this?
Unfortunately the patch is too long to post to the list
but it really is as simple as the description (below) claims.

I can handle the patch longness problem by pushing it into
lvs-2.6 and getting Dave to do a pull from there. But I'd
like to make sure that the move is ok with you first.

Thanks

IPVS: Move IPVS to net/netfilter/ipvs

Since IPVS now has partial IPv6 support, this patch moves IPVS from
net/ipv4/ipvs to net/netfilter/ipvs. It's a result of:

$ git mv net/ipv4/ipvs net/netfilter

and adapting the relevant Kconfigs/Makefiles to the new path.
