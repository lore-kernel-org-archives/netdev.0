Thanks, I've applied that.  (The bug is a little subtle: there's
actually two previous __svc_print_addr() calls which might have
initialized "buf" correctly, and it's not obvious that the second isn't
always called (since it's in a dprintk, which is a macro that expands
into a printk inside a conditional)).

So to be clear: there's not an actual problem here other than that the
logs are getting spammed?  (Not that that isn't a problem in itself.)

Hm, thanks.
