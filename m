So I did some experiments and removed the ip_vs_post_routing()
function that stops further POSTROUTING processing. I added an SNAT
rule to POSTROUTING like this:

$ iptables =96t nat =96A POSTROUTING =96o eth1 =96j SNAT =96-to $DIP

Amazingly, the first SYN and the SYN/ACK of a TCP connection to the
VIP:vport do not traverse the NAT chain in POSTROUTING at all
(verified by LOG target), so their source is not rewritten (like in
normal LVS/NAT). However, the client's ACK response to the SYN/ACK
finally appears in this table and only this third packet is SNATed
correctly (the real server then answers with an RST, since it doesn't
know a connection from that source). The packet trace on the director
looks something like this:

Packet 1:
CIP =3D> VIP SYN (eth0, before IPVS)
CIP =3D> RIP SYN (eth1, after IPVS)

Packet 2:
RIP =3D> CIP SYN/ACK (eth1, before IPVS)
VIP =3D> CIP SYN/ACK (eth0, after IPVS)

Packet 3:
CIP =3D> VIP ACK (eth0, before IPVS)
DIP =3D> RIP ACK (eth1, after IPVS) - this is the first successfully
SNATed packet!

Packet 4:
RIP =3D> DIP RST - real server doesn't know this connection from the DI=
P

Any ideas why the first packets never appear in the POSTROUTING chain?
I do not understand this, since IPVS injects all handled packets into
the OUTPUT chain, whereafter they should traverse POSTROUTING...

Without any IPVS, SNAT works without any problems and as expected,
only the first (SYN) packet of a connection appears on the POSTROUTING
chain.

Thanks, interesting! Though for processing an already IPVS-ed packet
in POSTROUTING, it should be enough to match on skb->ipvs_property, I
think.
