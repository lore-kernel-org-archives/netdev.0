...I still argue that if title gives the same information as that 
sentence would, the sentence is optional. Some patches don't even have 
patch description beyond title and there's very little problem with that. 
As I admitted earlier the title wasn't as good as it should have (and I 
even sent a followup to please all including even the in body sentence 
plus the fixed title). Not that I find the title really a problem to sane 
people who understand that code-duplication is bad and getting rid of it 
is what one should do in general, as long as it's possible without making 
a mess out of it.

I don't understand why a tool output cannot "say" the same as some English 
sentence... And if a proof that the code blocks that were merged were 
infact identical (instead of having some hard to spot difference) doesn't 
seem like useful information to reviewer I don't really know what to say.

Please note that I couldn't guess that I'd have to look for another entry 
after first SUNRPC entry in the MAINTAINERS. So asking outsider to know
who is who in sunrpc realm is not very likely to be a practical 
requirement either. And even to add into confusion the latest commits 
in that particular directory had the last S-o-B line as Bruce's. How could 
I have guessed? Forgetting to lookup the address from MAINTAINERS into the 
first mail is something which just happened and I'm certainly guilty to 
that :-).

...I've had enough down turning experiences with random dev lists listed 
in the MAINTAINERS (mostly spammy subsriber only ones, nearly infinite 
response time, etc things) that I mostly ignore them nowadays though this 
time it would have been vger list so no subscription required madness. 
Instead I either select lkml or netdev, this time netdev because of 
the obvious presence under net/ hierarcy.

Well, this kind of thinking is beyond me and requires more knowledge about 
internals of the code. IMHO, this kind of speculation changes nothing 
really, and besides the functions _were_ different to begin with as was
proven in the patch description :-). ...Would they have been fully 
identical you would have seen a bit different patch ;-).

If you think there's something wrong, please fix, you're free to do so,
I don't understand enough. But we don't keep all those #if 0 blocks 
around either just because somebody thinks that something will get 
implemented one day (not that you directly made such assertion, probably 
saying mildy the opposite instead). Ironically, you would have been 
perfectly happy with the particular functions unless a cleanup patch 
against them gets made... :-)

IMHO, this is the most useful response so far! :-) Usually the hardest 
obstacles I face with non-familiar code is its structure and naming.
