Hello, David!

I have a need, I didn't wake up some day and I dreamed to change this.
I have a gateway with LVS and I have 4 web servers behind.
I saw the help text at that option and I saw that I could raise the limit.

I was looking for anything that could get me past of 88.000 request per
seconds.
The help text told me to raise that value if I have big number of
connections. I just needed an easy way to test.

Without easy testing (boot time change not compile time change) is hard to
tell if it helps me or not.

Anyway, if the help text is wrong, let's correct it.
If it is correct, let's allow changing that value at runtime, so people
can easy juggle with it.

Do you agree, David?

Thank you.
