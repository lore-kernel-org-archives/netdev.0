Yes, both of that makes sense, thank you!

This function was never tested because IIRC there was/is no
decapsulation support for IPv6 in IPv6 tunneling on the receiving side
(please correct me if I'm wrong). I sent some packets through it which
somehow arrived at the real server, but that was about it. So the
whole code in that function is pretty only an idea of how the v6
tunneling should work ;)
