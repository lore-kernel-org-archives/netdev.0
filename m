Which is entirely correct -- that part is really not suitable for
consideration in mainline. There are several such duct-tape measures
in the test tree, which will have to wait until there is enough time
to fix each of the causes and test the replaced code.

There are problems of the mainline DCCP variant which are fixed in the
test tree, but until everything has been resolved will take some time.
