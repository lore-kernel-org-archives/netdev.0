If you grep for rpc_mkpipe() you'll see it's only used in the idmapping
and rpcsec_gss code; which means you wouldn't need it unless using NFSv4
(which uses idmapping) or rpcsec_gss.

If you want to see the code on the userland side of the interfaces, see
utils/gssd and utils/idmapd in the nfs-utils code.
