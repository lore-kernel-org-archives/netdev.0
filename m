And you wrote that code, I acted on looking the code together with
reading the changeset comment, to me it also looked much better to do
that, but as there were many changes, I sent an [RFC] message. It served
its purpose, as you after two iterations realised it was in fact not a
good idea as later an array of pointers is required. I should have taken
that swap routine as the definitive hint that indeed it was needed.

That is why it is important that the changeset comment collects these
scattered notes and discussions. Think about in some years from now we
will be left with a situation where we would have to look at many places
to understando some aspects of what is in the code. While this happens
and we have google for that I think that since you keep such detailed
notes it is not a problem to get them in the changesets.

come) it is adding a packet to the history. In the past it went to a
list, now we have a ring and don't keep more than TFRC_NDUPACK + 1

And that, along with credit to you is being provided on the few patches
I change.

I did this for the RX handling, where changes were made. Did that for
the TX but ended up commiting before comments from you, but I think its
fair to say that the changes for the TX history were more organizational
than in the essence of the algorithm.

I will revert to your original flow.

OK, I think I exaggerated on the changes and that you exaggerated on the
reaction, lets try to tone down both behaviours and we'll move on.

No intention, I was fearing your reaction would escalate and asking for
other people that are more experienced in maintainership, telling about
my and your mistakes in interacting could help. But I think we're going
back on track by ourselves, thank you.
