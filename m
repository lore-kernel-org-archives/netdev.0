The caller I found was ip6t_do_table which does deactivate bottom halves.
Maybe there are others I did not see, so double checking is better.

Is your kernel compiled with CONFIG_IPV6_ROUTER_PREF?

Ok, that's a nice simplification. I'll have a look tomorrow.

I cannot test my patch today any more, so I just leave it here. It is only
compile tested. Maybe you can make use of it:

Btw: I cannot put a reference to the rt6_info into __rt6_probe_work because we
are not supposed to use rt6_info reference counters outside of ip6_fib
because the deletion from the fib will break otherwise.

Maybe we should also create a seperate ipv6 workqueue. Will check later.
