As a side note, just noticed that this opens another race condition, if we 
leave the mutex serializing the [gs]etsockopt calls out:

If the timer reschedules itself, after we just removed the last estimator, 
but we failed to deactivate the timer due to it being active, we have the 
chance of add_timer() on already pending timer during creating a new 
estimator. This will then trigger the BUG_ON() in add_timer(). Thanks to 
the mutex this can't happen currently.

The "ipvs: Embed estimator object into stats object" patch will move to 
code from add_timer() to mod_timer() so at the the end of this series 
we're safe.
