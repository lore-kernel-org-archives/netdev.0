The majority of refcounted objects are allocated with refcount=1: the
very fact that they're being allocated means that they already have a
user.

The issue with struct nfsd4_session is that, like struct nfs4_client,
references to it are only taken when the server is actively working on
it.  Its default "resting state" is with refcount=0.

I would like to make its default resting state with refcount=1.  In
other cases similar to this, we've gotten around it by doing a
semantic +1 to the object's overall refcounting scheme.

Jeff suggested taking an additional reference in init_session(), and
dropping it in is_session_dead(), after determining, in fact, that the
object is DEAD.

When considering refcounted objects, the most "natural" interpretation
of refcount=0 means that the object no longer has any users and can be
freed.  Increments on objects with refcount=0 shouldn't be allowed, as
this may indicate a use-after-free condition.

This discussion is difficult because the refcount_t API hasn't yet
been introduced.  The purpose of that API is to eliminate
use-after-free bugs.
