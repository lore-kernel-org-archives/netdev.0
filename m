| Thanks, I folded this into the reorganized RX history handling patch,
| together with reverting ccid3_hc_rx_packet_recv to very close to your
| original patch, with this changes:
| 
| 1. no need to calculate the payload size for non data packets as this
|    value won't be used.
| 2. Initialize hcrx->ccid3hcrx_bytes_recv with the payload size when
|    hcrx->ccid3hcrx_state == TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA.
| 3. tfrc_rx_hist_duplicate() is only called when ccid3hcrx_state !=
|    TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA, so it doesn't need to goto the done_receiving
|    label (that was removed as this was its only use) as do_feedback
|    would always be CCID3_FBACK_NONE and so the test would always fail
|    and no feedback would be sent, so just return right there.
| 
| Now it reads:
| 
| static void ccid3_hc_rx_packet_recv(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb)
| {
| 	struct ccid3_hc_rx_sock *hcrx = ccid3_hc_rx_sk(sk);
| 	enum ccid3_fback_type do_feedback = CCID3_FBACK_NONE;
| 	const u32 ndp = dccp_sk(sk)->dccps_options_received.dccpor_ndp;
| 	const bool is_data_packet = dccp_data_packet(skb);
| 
| 	if (unlikely(hcrx->ccid3hcrx_state == TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA)) {
| 		if (is_data_packet) {
| 			const u32 payload = skb->len - dccp_hdr(skb)->dccph_doff * 4;
| 			do_feedback = FBACK_INITIAL;
| 			ccid3_hc_rx_set_state(sk, TFRC_RSTATE_DATA);
| 			hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s =
| 				hcrx->ccid3hcrx_bytes_recv = payload_size;

  ==> Please see other email regarding bytes_recv, but I think you already got that.
      Maybe one could then write
      	hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s = skb->len - dccp_hdr(skb)->dccph_doff * 4;
 
| 		}
| 		goto update_records;
|  	}
| 
| 	if (tfrc_rx_hist_duplicate(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb))
| 		return; /* done receiving */
| 
| 	if (is_data_packet) {
| 		const u32 payload = skb->len - dccp_hdr(skb)->dccph_doff * 4;
| 		/*
| 		 * Update moving-average of s and the sum of received payload bytes
| 		 */
| 		hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s = tfrc_ewma(hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s, payload_size, 9);
| 		hcrx->ccid3hcrx_bytes_recv += payload_size;
|  	}
| 
| 	/*
| 	 * Handle pending losses and otherwise check for new loss
| 	 */
| 	if (tfrc_rx_hist_new_loss_indicated(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb, ndp))
| 		goto update_records;
| 
| 	/*
| 	 * Handle data packets: RTT sampling and monitoring p
| 	 */
| 	if (unlikely(!is_data_packet))
| 		goto update_records;
| 
| 	if (list_empty(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_li_hist)) {  /* no loss so far: p = 0 */
| 		const u32 sample = tfrc_rx_hist_sample_rtt(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb);
==> If you like, you could add the original comment here that p=0 if no	loss occured, i.e.
		/*
		 * Empty loss history: no loss so far, hence p stays 0.
		 * Sample RTT values, since an RTT estimate is required for the
		 * computation of p when the first loss occurs; RFC 3448, 6.3.1.
		 */
| 		if (sample != 0)
| 			hcrx->ccid3hcrx_rtt = tfrc_ewma(hcrx->ccid3hcrx_rtt, sample, 9);
| 	}
| 
| 	/*
| 	 * Check if the periodic once-per-RTT feedback is due; RFC 4342, 10.3
| 	 */
| 	if (SUB16(dccp_hdr(skb)->dccph_ccval, hcrx->ccid3hcrx_last_counter) > 3)
| 		do_feedback = CCID3_FBACK_PERIODIC;
| 
| update_records:	
| 	tfrc_rx_hist_add_packet(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb, ndp);
| 
==>  here a jump label is missing. It is not needed by this patch and
     above you have replaced it with a return + comment, but it is needed in a later
     patch: when a new loss event occurs, the control jumps to `done_receiving' and
     sends a feedback packet with type FBACK_PARAM_CHANGE.
done_receiving:
| 	if (do_feedback)
| 		ccid3_hc_rx_send_feedback(sk, skb, do_feedback);
| }
| 

| Now to some questions and please bear with me as I haven't got to the
| patches after this:
| 
| tfrc_rx_hist->loss_count as of now is a boolean, my understanding is
| that you are counting loss events, i.e. it doesn't matter in:
|
It is not a boolean, but uses a hidden trick which maybe should be commented:
 * here and in the TCP world NDUPACK = 3
 * hence the bitfield size for loss_count is 2 bits, which can express
   at most 3 = NDUPACK (that is why it is declared as loss_count:2)
 * the trick is that when the loss count increases beyond 3, it automatically 
   cycles back to 0 (although the code does not rely on that features
   and does this explicitly);
 * loss_start is the same


| /* any data packets missing between last reception and skb ? */
| int tfrc_rx_hist_new_loss_indicated(struct tfrc_rx_hist *h,
| 				    const struct sk_buff *skb, u32 ndp)
| {
| 	int delta = dccp_delta_seqno(tfrc_rx_hist_last_rcv(h)->tfrchrx_seqno,
| 				     DCCP_SKB_CB(skb)->dccpd_seq);
| 
| 	if (delta > 1 && ndp < delta)
| 		tfrc_rx_hist_loss_indicated(h);
| 
| 	return tfrc_rx_hist_loss_pending(h);
| }
| 
| if (delta - ndp) is > 1, i.e. tfrc_rx_hist->loss_count only indicates
| that there was loss. But then in other parts of the code it assumes it
| can be more than 1:
In the above case the first loss is recorded in the history, which is
why loss_count is set to 1. Maybe it gets clearer in the next patch set,
which has three helper functions
 __one_after_loss: to deal with the first lost packet
 __two_after_loss: which deals when loss_count=2 packets are missing
 __three_after_loss is already a new loss event (3=NDUPACK), so that
   function only recycles the loss records



| /**

|  * @loss_start:		Movable index (for loss detection)

|  */
| struct tfrc_rx_hist {
| 	struct tfrc_rx_hist_entry *ring[TFRC_NDUPACK + 1];
| 	u8			  loss_count:2,
| 				  loss_start:2;
| #define rtt_sample_prev		  loss_start
| };
| 
| There is space for TFRC_NDUPACK + 1 possible values in loss_count (:2)
| and the comment says it is the number of entries in the circular
| history, and also:
| 
| /* has the packet contained in skb been seen before? */
| int tfrc_rx_hist_duplicate(struct tfrc_rx_hist *h, struct sk_buff *skb)
| {
| 	const u64 seq = DCCP_SKB_CB(skb)->dccpd_seq;
| 	int i;
| 
| 	if (dccp_delta_seqno(tfrc_rx_hist_loss_prev(h)->tfrchrx_seqno, seq) <= 0)
| 		return 1;
| 
| 	for (i = 1; i <= h->loss_count; i++)
| 		if (tfrc_rx_hist_entry(h, i)->tfrchrx_seqno == seq)
| 			return 1;
| 
| 	return 0;
| }
| 
| With the current code this will always check just one entry, as
| loss_count only gets to 1 in tfrc_rx_hist_loss_indicated.
|
Again the resolution is in the next patch: 
 * when loss_count = 0 (no loss so far), loss_indicated() is called, sets loss_count = 2
 * when loss_count = 1, __one_after_loss() is called, which checks if this a genuine loss
  --> it then has the line
  	h->loss_count = 2;	/* second packet lost */
 * when loss_count = 2, __two_after_loss() is called,
   - this function returns 1 when the current packet indicates a genuine loss
   - in that case loss_count is set to 3
 * when loss_count = 3, __three_after_loss() is called, and the whole structure is recycled.
