Julius: pong

The main two problems that I see in the existing interface are
a) lack of extendibility (which is why we are here) and;
b) non-idempotent actions, especially adding and deleting
   real servers, which mean that user-space programs that
   manipulate ipvsadm have have extra (racy) logic.
   (ok, perhaps that is more a pet peeve than a problem).

I don't really have any concrete ideas about what a better
interface would look like. But I am more than happy to hash our ideas.
