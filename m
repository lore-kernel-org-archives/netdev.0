| Doesn't this belongs into struct ccid_operations? Why has the core feature
| negotiation have knowledge of any specific CCID? When people want to
| merge CCID 4, 5, etc will we need to change net/dccp/feat.c?
|

| 
| struct ccid_operations *ccids[CCID_MAX]
| 
| ccids[ccid_number]->deps
|  
Your point is valid and one could do it this way. At the moment I can
not see an advantage. From experience, there is actually an advantage of
keeping all the dependencies in one file (feat.c): since CCID-4 use
mostly the same (TFRC) concepts as CCID-3, it can reuse the existing
ccid3_dependencies[] table, rather than copy-and-pasting it (this can
be seen in the commitdiff link for CCID-4 in the other posting).

For the moment, I would suggest keeping it in place. It is an easy patch
to do it later. The reason I am holding back here is that there is a
much larger potential for integration - as in the initial patches by
Tommi and Leandro, the mostly-identical TFRC functionality of CCID-3
and CCID-4 can be combined. Progress here has been impeded by waiting
for rfc3448bis-06 to reach RFC status, which it very soon:
ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/authors/rfc5348.txt

But all this does not mean I disagree. There is a related spot which
I think should be CCID-specific: the "print" subroutine in
net/dccp/probe.c - at the moment, the CCIDs are hardcoded. Here it would
indeed be good to have a struct ccid_operations function pointer instead
of hardcoding the current CCID.
