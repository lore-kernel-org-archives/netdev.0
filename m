We are happy to announce the release of ipvsadm v1.29.

 ipvsadm is a utility to administer the kernels IPVS/LVS load-balancer service

It has been far too long since the last ipvsadm release. Even-though
only two changes to the ipvsadm tool happened since last release, a
release must be made as these feature relates to kernel side features.

Support for reading 64-bit stats is avail since kernel v4.1.  The new
attributes for sync daemon got introduced in kernel v4.3, but got
fixed in kernel v4.7.

Merry Xmas and a Happy New year to all :-)


This release is based on the kernel.org git tree:
