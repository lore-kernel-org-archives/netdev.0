I have been looking around for alternatives - there are some
very good solutions for such aspects in the SCTP subsystem. 

They implement the subscription of event notifications on a socket for
all sorts of events.

A socket option performs this subscription, notifications are then passed
along with data (I think also without, have not dug deep enough into the
sources), via recvmsg(). This is the inverse path to qpolicies: the
ancillary data is passed via cmsg(3) wrappers to the user.

To distinguish events from normal (ancillary) data, SCTP sets the
flag fields to MSG_NOTIFICATION.

There are two good papers on this (the second one is a bit older):
http://www.bsdcan.org/2008/schedule/events/91.en.html
http://lwn.net/2001/features/OLS/pdf/pdf/sctp.pdf

The sources are in net/sctp, the lksctp project is hosted at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lksctp

I think that this approach is elegant and has something to offer for
DCCP as well. What do you think?

| determined by other means.

I am trying to think in terms of how much documentation this would need
in order to explain to someone how to use it. It seems feasible, but to
me a bit complicated.

Yes that was why I had reservations against using the ringbuffer API by Lai/Kohler
(implemented for TCP in	http://heim.ifi.uio.no/paalh/publications/files/ism07.pdf ).

We could consider this for later, but it does not seem easy to do this
both in a safe and in a non-complicated way.
