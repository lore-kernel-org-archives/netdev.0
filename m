Thanks.

Here are a few thoughts I have had in my breif overview of the code so far
- mainly just simple style things. If any of my comments are obviously
stupid, please just say so as I haven't got to the end of the series yet
and I'm sure some of my questions are answered in the code.

[PATCH RFC 01/24] IPVS: Add genetlink interface definitions to ip_vs.h
[PATCH RFC 02/24] IPVS: Add genetlink interface implementation

* Already in lvs-2.6. Are there any changes?

[PATCH RFC 02/24] IPVS: Add genetlink interface implementation

* What is IP_VS = IPV6 ?

[PATCH RFC 04/24] IPVS: Change IPVS data structures to support IPv6 addresses

* Indentation of af in struct ip_vs_conn seems inconsistent with other
  elements.

[PATCH RFC 05/24] IPVS: Add general v4/v6 helper functions / data structures

* Use of p ? a : b construct in ip_vs_addr_equal() seems a bit aquard.
  How about

static inline int ip_vs_addr_equal(int af, const union nf_inet_addr *a,
				   const union nf_inet_addr *b)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6
	if (af == AF_INET)
		return ipv6_addr_equal(&a->in6, &b->in6);
#endif
	return a->ip == b->ip;
}
