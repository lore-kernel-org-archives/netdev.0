I agree - having a new sync daemon which can deal with v6 entries aswell
as v4 entries would be a good way to work; the legacy code can then be
retired at a later date with minimal end-user impact.

Well, as someone else mentioned on lvs-users recently "I couldn't code
my way out of a wet paper bag in C" so I'm not much help on that front,
however I feel that getting the minimal working feature set going first
and then adding the sync code later is probably a good way to proceed.

This also gives us a development timeline that we can offer to
interested parties, along the lines of:

2008-10 Minimal IPv6 functionality
2008-?? Full IPv6 functionality matching IPv4 features, no IPv6 sync
2009-?? Restructured sync daemon with full IPv4 and IPv6 support

Horms, Joe - do you agree that this is a good idea?

Graeme
