	Unfortunately, I don't have suitable
hardware to do real tests, only virtual setup.

	This patchset converts all global locks to RCU,
except the __ip_vs_svc_lock usage. The states in
some schedulers probably will need some protection
with lock as before now, others like WLC and LC will
run (after patchset2) just under RCU lock for the 
svc->destinations list. But I'll need some time to
finalize this 2nd patchset because there are other
patches in the queue...

	So, the answer is that packets that create
connections (via schedulers) hit this __ip_vs_svc_lock
with read_lock and some write lock in scheduler.
This happens only when connection is created. Next packets
should not reach any global locks in IPVS. The cached
dst->refcnt is not changed anymore for traffic to
real server.
