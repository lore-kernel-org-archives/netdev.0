Yes, I've based it on your tree.

In this patch series, no. I prefer them like sizeof(*tbl) as it's more 
robust, when changing the type of tbl. Changing the type of tbl and 
forgeting the sizeof() in kmalloc will result in hard to track down bugs, 
if the old type is still valid. Using sizeof(*tbl) will nearly always get 
you the correct value you want, without keeping all the types in sizeof() 
in sync. The compiler already knows the type of tbl, so no need to be 
explicit about it, when allocating memory for it.
