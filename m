Thanks, I knew I was missing something obvious.  From a style point of
view, I'm not sure either, but it seems like a reasonable start. Perhaps a
slight enhancement would be to add a BUG_ON() to ip_vs_dbg_addr() which will
trigger if ip_vs_dbg_buf will overflow.

I only noticed it from fixing up the atio() problem in ipvsadm
that I posted a patch for the other day. Its not a big deal. But
it would be nice to eliminate dead code.

I realise this is a pain but unfortunately it is needed.

This is less critical, but thankfully easy :-)
