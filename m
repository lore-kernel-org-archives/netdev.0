This should not happen often enough to be statistically meaningful.

If it does we have serious lock contention and we should fix that.

This could be argued as a bug in the hrtimer interface.  What it should
do is let you use the interfaces always, and the kernel gives you as
fine a resolution as the current configuration supports.

This argument is sound.

I wouldn't bother with high resolution timers, mostly because they are more
expensive and the benefit of them here is at best "unknown".
