When looking at kobject_rename I found two bugs with
that exist when sysfs support is disabled in the kernel.

kobject_rename does not change the name on the kobject when
sysfs support is not compiled in.

kobject_rename without locking attempts to check the
validity of a rename operation, which the kobject layer
simply does not have the infrastructure to do so.

This patch documents the previously unstated requirement of
kobject_rename that is the responsibility of the caller to
provide mutual exclusion and to be certain that the new_name
for the kobject is valid.

This patch modifies sysfs_rename_dir in !CONFIG_SYSFS case
to call kobject_set_name to actually change the kobject_name.

This patch removes the bogus and misleading check in kobject_rename
that attempts to see if a rename is valid.  The check is bogus
because we do not have the proper locking.  The check is misleading
because it looks like we can and do perform useful checking at the
kobject level that we don't.

The users in net/core/dev.c already have all of the necessary checks
in place and don't care.  The other use in net/core/wireless.c 
as originally implemented is incorrect because it performs no locking
and a simple patch has been sent that adds the necessary locking
and sanity checks there.  Ensuring this patch will not have an
effect on users of kobject_rename or device_rename.

 There is a function called kobject_set_name() but that is legacy cruft and
 is being removed.  If your code needs to call this function, it is
 incorrect and needs to be fixed.
