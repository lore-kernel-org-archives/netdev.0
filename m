Your locking description is exactly how it was intented by me.

It looks suspicous, but word-size writes should be atomic by itself. So 
even doing it under read lock should not lead to corrupted values. We 
don't care if the values that are set concurrently are overwritten, 
because they should only differ in a couple of jiffies. Might be good to 
have someone other comment on the issue too.

Yeah, that's the point where we prevent the race with the trash purging. 
We could change the purging of destinations from the trash to be under 
__ip_vs_svc_lock write locked, then we know that all destinations, even 
the ones in the trash are valid. Might make more sense than duplicating 
this logic in other schedulers.
