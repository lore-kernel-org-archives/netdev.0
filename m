Thank you.  By now the patch looks completely different from my original
patch, so I don't think I deserve to be mentioned in the Author line.

I should have used the stable link format to refer to the disucssion in
LKML instead of the lkml.org URL.  The stable link is

Having my name in the comment itself looks a little odd, since I don't
see other places in the kernel source code that mentions the reporter's
name.

The above line contains an extra "it".
