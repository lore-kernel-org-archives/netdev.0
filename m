Right at the moment I think this message is a coincidence.  But let's  
chase it a little and see what we get.

First, you provided a couple of kernel log snippets here, but you  
didn't identify which snippet comes from your server, and which from  
your client.  I assume the above one comes from your server, and the  
below comes from your client.

Do you happen to have IPv6 configured on your systems ("ifconfig - 
a")?  What is the output of "rpcinfo" on your client and on your  
server?  Are you running portmap or rpcbind on these systems?

"cat /proc/mounts" on your client so we can see exactly what mount  
options the kernel has chosen.

Have you captured a network trace?   Start the trace before mounting  
the server.  I usually use something like "sudo tethereal -w /tmp/raw" .
