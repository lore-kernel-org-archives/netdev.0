Thanks for the info! Right, I even said myself in the previous reply
that ip_vs_postrouting() stops further processing in the POSTROUTING
chain, so it never reaches netfilter NAT code.

I still think an in-IPVS SNAT would be nice anyways... don't know if
I'll find the time to hack on it soon, though.
