There is a similar problem with NFS/RDMA.

An IB device driver can be unloaded at any time. The driver performs
an upcall to all consumers to request that they release all RDMA
resources associated with the device.

For RPC-over-RDMA, we could kill all running RPCs at this point. Or,
the RPCs could be suspended in place. The latter is desirable if the
device were re-inserted, or there were an alternate path to the NFS
server: then there would be no workload interruption.

Signals would have to be allowed so that ^C and soft timeouts still
work as expected.
