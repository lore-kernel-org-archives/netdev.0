Ok, that is good news :-)

Sorry for the stuff up. That bugus ip_route_me_harder() call
was caused by me trying to merge the IPv6 patches with the local
client patches.

I'm not so concerned about IPv6 local not working for now -
its a combination of two new features. And hopefully we
can iron it out in the not to distant future anyway.

I'll drop CSUM2/3 and 3/3 for now, they aren't essential and
it really ought to be a matter of (me) sitting down and fixing
some correctness issues.


Its the end of my day now. I'll try and update lvs-next-2.6 into
a working state in the morning.
