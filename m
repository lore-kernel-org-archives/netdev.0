Hello,

as already described old temporary sockets (client is gone) of lockd ar=
en't
closed after some time. So, with enough clients and some time gone, the=
re
are 80 open dangling sockets and you start getting messages of the form=
:

lockd: too many open TCP sockets, consider increasing the number of nfs=
d threads.

If I understand the code then the intention was that the server closes
temporary sockets after about 6 to 12 minutes:

	a timer is started which calls svc_age_temp_sockets every 6 minutes.

	svc_age_temp_sockets:
		if a socket is marked OLD it gets closed.
		sockets which are not marked as OLD are marked OLD

	every time the sockets receives something OLD is cleared.

But svc_age_temp_sockets never closes any socket though because it only
closes sockets with svsk->sk_inuse =3D=3D 0. This seems to be a bug.

Here is a patch against 2.6.22.6 which changes the test to
svsk->sk_inuse <=3D 0 which was probably meant. The patched kernel runs=
 fine
here. Unused sockets get closed (after 6 to 12 minutes)

As svc_age_temp_sockets did not do anything before this change may trig=
ger
hidden bugs.

To be true I don't see why this check

(atomic_read(&svsk->sk_inuse) <=3D 0 || test_bit(SK_BUSY, &svsk->sk_fla=
gs))

is needed at all (it can only be an optimation) as this fields change a=
fter
the check. In svc_tcp_accept there is no such check when a temporary so=
cket
is closed.
