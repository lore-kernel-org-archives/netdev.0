	In IPv4 rt->rt_flags has no bit to indicate if the route
is via gateway (like RTF_GATEWAY in IPv6). We added rt_uses_gateway
for this purpose.

	In the default case, rt_gateway may contain 0 if we return
cached result, eg. when target is part of a local subnet.
Then IPVS/TEE/RAW can request valid rt_gateway, even with the price
of a cloned result, so that rt_gateway can remember the requested
nexthop which may differ from daddr.

	dst_check works for IPVS. There is a problem only
with the recent changes that moved the indication for PMTU
change from dst_check to dst_mtu() calls. But this is safe 
for IPVS, it handles FRAG_NEEDED for the tunneling mode itself.

	Initially, I thought IPv6 stores zeroes in rt6i_gateway.
But now I see rt6_alloc_cow() to be called for the case I assumed
to fail - when no gateway is used.

	So, I'll try to test the IPVS case in the following 1-2 days
and will report after adding some printks. If xt_TEE has
the same problem then it should not be IPVS-specific. RAW not
tested yet.
