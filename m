Thanks, I folded this into the reorganized RX history handling patch,
together with reverting ccid3_hc_rx_packet_recv to very close to your
original patch, with this changes:

1. no need to calculate the payload size for non data packets as this
   value won't be used.
2. Initialize hcrx->ccid3hcrx_bytes_recv with the payload size when
   hcrx->ccid3hcrx_state == TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA.
3. tfrc_rx_hist_duplicate() is only called when ccid3hcrx_state !=
   TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA, so it doesn't need to goto the done_receiving
   label (that was removed as this was its only use) as do_feedback
   would always be CCID3_FBACK_NONE and so the test would always fail
   and no feedback would be sent, so just return right there.

Now it reads:

static void ccid3_hc_rx_packet_recv(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct ccid3_hc_rx_sock *hcrx = ccid3_hc_rx_sk(sk);
	enum ccid3_fback_type do_feedback = CCID3_FBACK_NONE;
	const u32 ndp = dccp_sk(sk)->dccps_options_received.dccpor_ndp;
	const bool is_data_packet = dccp_data_packet(skb);

	if (unlikely(hcrx->ccid3hcrx_state == TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA)) {
		if (is_data_packet) {
			const u32 payload = skb->len - dccp_hdr(skb)->dccph_doff * 4;
			do_feedback = FBACK_INITIAL;
			ccid3_hc_rx_set_state(sk, TFRC_RSTATE_DATA);
			hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s =
				hcrx->ccid3hcrx_bytes_recv = payload_size;
		}
		goto update_records;
 	}

	if (tfrc_rx_hist_duplicate(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb))
		return; /* done receiving */

	if (is_data_packet) {
		const u32 payload = skb->len - dccp_hdr(skb)->dccph_doff * 4;
		/*
		 * Update moving-average of s and the sum of received payload bytes
		 */
		hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s = tfrc_ewma(hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s, payload_size, 9);
		hcrx->ccid3hcrx_bytes_recv += payload_size;
 	}

	/*
	 * Handle pending losses and otherwise check for new loss
	 */
	if (tfrc_rx_hist_new_loss_indicated(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb, ndp))
		goto update_records;

	/*
	 * Handle data packets: RTT sampling and monitoring p
	 */
	if (unlikely(!is_data_packet))
		goto update_records;

	if (list_empty(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_li_hist)) {  /* no loss so far: p = 0 */
		const u32 sample = tfrc_rx_hist_sample_rtt(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb);
		if (sample != 0)
			hcrx->ccid3hcrx_rtt = tfrc_ewma(hcrx->ccid3hcrx_rtt, sample, 9);
	}

	/*
	 * Check if the periodic once-per-RTT feedback is due; RFC 4342, 10.3
	 */
	if (SUB16(dccp_hdr(skb)->dccph_ccval, hcrx->ccid3hcrx_last_counter) > 3)
		do_feedback = CCID3_FBACK_PERIODIC;

update_records:	
	tfrc_rx_hist_add_packet(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist, skb, ndp);

	if (do_feedback)
		ccid3_hc_rx_send_feedback(sk, skb, do_feedback);
}

Now to some questions and please bear with me as I haven't got to the
patches after this:

tfrc_rx_hist->loss_count as of now is a boolean, my understanding is
that you are counting loss events, i.e. it doesn't matter in:

/* any data packets missing between last reception and skb ? */
int tfrc_rx_hist_new_loss_indicated(struct tfrc_rx_hist *h,
				    const struct sk_buff *skb, u32 ndp)
{
	int delta = dccp_delta_seqno(tfrc_rx_hist_last_rcv(h)->tfrchrx_seqno,
				     DCCP_SKB_CB(skb)->dccpd_seq);

	if (delta > 1 && ndp < delta)
		tfrc_rx_hist_loss_indicated(h);

	return tfrc_rx_hist_loss_pending(h);
}

if (delta - ndp) is > 1, i.e. tfrc_rx_hist->loss_count only indicates
that there was loss. But then in other parts of the code it assumes it
can be more than 1:

/**
 * tfrc_rx_hist  -  RX history structure for TFRC-based protocols
 *
 * @ring:		Packet history for RTT sampling and loss detection
 * @loss_count:		Number of entries in circular history
 * @loss_start:		Movable index (for loss detection)
 * @rtt_sample_prev:	Used during RTT sampling, points to candidate entry
 */
struct tfrc_rx_hist {
	struct tfrc_rx_hist_entry *ring[TFRC_NDUPACK + 1];
	u8			  loss_count:2,
				  loss_start:2;
#define rtt_sample_prev		  loss_start
};

There is space for TFRC_NDUPACK + 1 possible values in loss_count (:2)
and the comment says it is the number of entries in the circular
history, and also:

/* has the packet contained in skb been seen before? */
int tfrc_rx_hist_duplicate(struct tfrc_rx_hist *h, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	const u64 seq = DCCP_SKB_CB(skb)->dccpd_seq;
	int i;

	if (dccp_delta_seqno(tfrc_rx_hist_loss_prev(h)->tfrchrx_seqno, seq) <= 0)
		return 1;

	for (i = 1; i <= h->loss_count; i++)
		if (tfrc_rx_hist_entry(h, i)->tfrchrx_seqno == seq)
			return 1;

	return 0;
}

With the current code this will always check just one entry, as
loss_count only gets to 1 in tfrc_rx_hist_loss_indicated.

I'm not implying there is an error, I need to read the patches that
follow, I'm just trying to get over coding conventions and basic
algorithm sanity tests.

I'll look at your page looking for extra explanations about this.
