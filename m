I haven't applied the patch and done a diff to individual files to be c=
ertain, but I'm pretty sure that the patch is mainly just a directory c=
hange. IPVS itself is already fairly well abstracted protocol-wise. Jus=
t another guess, but it sounds like Julius is submitting the patch as i=

Call me crazy, but I plan to put my patch into production in two weeks =
time without the connect-to-vip-from-director parts. If everything goes=
 well, I'll post patches again with adequate comments (and adjustments =
to comments). And to make this relevant: My patches don't do anything p=
rotocol specific other than to change when things are done and so would=
 be fairly easy to update for IPV6 if/when it is integrated.
