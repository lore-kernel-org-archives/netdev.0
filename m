I haven't quite grokked what XPRT_LOCKED is supposed to signify. What
would be the advantage of doing that over just killing off the
task_cleanup job? It seems like if we're tearing down the xprt then
waiting for task_cleanup to run is sort of pointless -- xs_destroy will
take care of closing the socket anyway.

Also, if we do go that route, do we need a wake_up_bit call in
xprt_clear_locked?
