Just forwarding my reply to the list netdev and dccp lists, the text
was in HTML format and Majordomo rejected it...

David and others,
=A0=A0=A0 I don't think this change will make sense for DCCP, once IW10=
 is
for the cases of short-lived flows. DCCP is used on scenarios for
multimedia flows, which are, in general, long-lived flows. So, IMO the
way how we calculate IW for DCCP is appropriate, at least considering
a quick answer. In fact, nowadays we need better congestion control
algorithms for DCCP, and in this sense we are working on adapt TCP
Cubic for DCCP as a CCID, and also we started some work to make DCCP
support TCP pluggable mechanism , which will allow us to use TCP
congestion control algorithms in DCCP.
=A0=A0=A0 I've been following all the discussions about IW10 in the TCP=
M
discussion list and also been reading all materials in this context
(papers and ppts) provided by Tom Herbert and Nandita Dukkipati (along
with other researchers from Networking Research Lab at North Carolina
State University), but although the results is really great (at least
for scenarios they've experimented and regardless to all opinions
expressed at TCPM), DCCP should calculate its IW as specified in
RFC3390 rather than set it to IW10. For the moment, I understand that
for DCCP, we have to discuss more about this in a separated thread.

Leandro.
