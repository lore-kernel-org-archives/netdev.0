This one is completely buggy, dont waste your time on it.

My plan for this one : dont try to have 64bit stats on 32bit arches, and
use plain "unsigned long" counters (if they are percpu), or
atomic_long_t (if they are shared by all cpus)

The writer sides might be run concurrently by several cpus, so
u64_stats_update_begin(&sstats->syncp); are racy : a reader can
be trapped forever.

Same problem for this one, I think.

I CCed ipvs maintainers so that they can take a look.

Thanks !
