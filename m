Nope.  That is a misunderstanding.  register_net_sysctl_table works for
anything under /proc/sys.

I think it was a misinformed decision.

I fully support not breaking userspace by moving where the sysctls file=
s
are.  If something sounds like I am suggesting moving sysctl files ther=
e
is a miscommunication somewhere.

The concept of a sysctl root as I had envisioned it and essentially as =
it
is implemented was a per namespace sysctl tree.  Those sysctl trees are
then unioned together when presented to user space.  There should only
be one root per namespace.

In practice what this means is that register_net_sysctl_table should
work for any sysctl file anywhere under /proc/sys.  I think
register_net_sysctl_table is the right solution for your problem.  The
only possible caveat I can think of is you might hit Al's performance
optimizations and need to create a common empty directory first with
register_sysctl_paths.


=2E...
That said since I am in the process of rewriting things some of this
may change a little bit, but hopefully not in ways that immediately
effect the users of register_sysctl_table.

Don't use register_net_sysctl_ro_table.   I think what the implementors
actually wanted was register_net_sysctl_table(&init_net, ...) and didn'=
t
know it.

Don't put subdirectories in your sysctl tables.  Use a ctl_path to
specify the entire directory where the files should show up.  Generally
the code is easier to read in that form, and the code is simpler to dea=
l
with if we don't have to worry about directories.

Don't play with the sysctl roots.  It is my intention to completely kil=
l
them off and replace them by moving the per net sysctl tree under
/proc/<pid>/sys/.   Leaving behind symlinks in /proc/sys/net and I gues=
s
ultimately in /proc/sys/sunrpc/ and /proc/sys/fs/nfs...  Which actually
seems to better describe your mental model.

Thank you for mentioning /proc/sys/fs/nfs.  That is a case I hadn't
thought about.  In thinking about it I see some deficiencies in my
rewrite that I need to correct before I push that code.
