Sorry this also has problems.

(Both 'i_i' and 'losses' are u32, so could write "i_i /= losses" instead.)

However, this computation is done in the wrong place: here it is already too
late. The N/K in RFC 4828 refers to entering each individual interval I_0, so
the division (and the check whether this is a "short" interval) needs to be
done when adding the interval, in tfrc_sp_lh_interval_add(). (There also exists
a special rule for the open interval I_0, see RFC 5348, 5.3.)

A second problem is a divide-by-zero condition encoded in the above: if
i_i < losses, the result is 0, if all intervals are 0 then I_mean = 0, and
thus p = 1/I_mean triggers a panic. In all other cases, the integer arithmetic
has the effect of floor(N/K), i.e. it decreases the interval length.

A way out (which does not fix the truncation problem) is to round up:

	if (losses > 0)
		i_i = DIV_ROUND_UP(i_i, losses);

In fact, we have to do this, to avoid the divide-by-zero condition.

The third problem is that the CCVal can be wrong, i.e. "less than 8" can
also mean that it just wrapped around one or more times. But this is noted
already in RFC 5622, it is a problem of the specification.

The line above the BUG_ON is probably a leftover. For the BUG_ON, this would
be too late (division by zero). 
In fact, the BUG_ON is not needed, due to testing for k <= 0, see
http://mirror.celinuxforum.org/gitstat//commit-detail.php?commit=eff253c4272cd2aac95ccff46d3d2e1a495f22b1

Should be division as per above.

This function already has the ccval available, so could use it instead
of just passing it through.
