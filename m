Ahem....

xprt_alloc_xid is quite safe. It's always called under xprt->xprt_lock.

The code in unlink.c is only called from dentry_iput() or from
sillyrename(). In either case, there is no possibility for SMP races.

I'll admit that the rpciod killer code is racy, but I'm not sure that
completions are the best answer, as they have at least one nasty feature:
they are not interruptible.
