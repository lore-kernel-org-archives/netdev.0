Yes, starting from scratch on another port sounds like a good idea.
Losing sync ability totally isn't as bad as confusing an older kernel
with new messages, so I hope it's not necessary to keep the old
baggage around?

Is there enough motivation for doing this though before having a
cleaned-up minimal v6 version without the sync daemon? This is where
I'm currently a bit stuck with... any help is appreciated :)
