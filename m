| If inet{,6}_skb_parm is used only outside DCCP code then why at all should it 
| be placed in struct dccp_skb_cb taking up quite a lot of valuable space? Why

| struct udp_skb_cb, struct tcp_skb_cb as well.
| 
With or without inet{,6}_sbk_parm there are a further unused 32 bits in the cb -- by
restricting the 48-bit sequence/ack numbers from their current u64 type to 48 bit
only.  This requires to change the parts which rely on DCCP_PKT_WITHOUT_ACK_SEQ,
but that seems possible to do. 
So we can reduce this to the other question "is 32 bit enough for priority information".

| 
No I don't agree. Things that work half are worse than constant failures, since
it is never clear when they will fail next. But maybe you didn't mean that.

| 
In both -- I will send an update in reply to this message and a link to
some user code. Very busy right now.

You are free to use what you think is best. But I think both ways are
equivalent, using e.g. typecasts to get from one to the other. I.e. 
I think we have no disagreement here.

| Ok, for now 32 bits are enough and I can't think of the need to use more bits.

So it only remains to see whether to use a field in dccp_skb_cb, or to
use skb->priority. I think the latter has advantages, since this field
is only set/used for the SO_PRIORITY field (in socket(7)).
