But socket doesn't get into non-blocking mode until specifically 
requested by fcntl(soc, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) call, does it?

I think that much of the previously written qpolicy code could be 
removed from the kernel so the interface would be really simple. No 
policy switching, no fancy parameters, etc. The only difference from 
standard interface would be that a packet could have a 'drop me' flag 
(priority 65 in my code). Ok, I agree some may consider it tricky but I 
wouldn't call it complicated. The complicated part is meant to be on the 
userspace side. And that in my opinion has many advantages: easier 
debugging, easier to add new (possibly complex) queuing policies.

On one test it seemed not to work at all in my setup: ccid3 seems not to 
limit traffic at all. But that was just one test so it may well be my fault.

Good point, thanks.
