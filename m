Wrong.

Please stop and take a look at /proc/net.  If your /proc/net is not a
symlink please look at a modern kernel.

/proc/<pid>/net reflects the network namespace of the task in question.

Yep.  Sysfs is weird.  Ideally sysfs would display all devices all of
the time but unfortunately that breaks backwards compatibility.

In proc we have the opportunity to display nearly everything all of the
time and I think that opportunity is worth seizing.

Having to mount a filesystem simply because the designers of the
filesystem were not creative enough to figure out how to display
all of the information the filesystem is responsible for displaying
without having namespace conflicts is unfortunate.

I think the way sysfs is done is a pain in the neck to use.  Especially
in the context of commands like "ip netns exec".  With the sysfs model
there is a lot of extra state to manage.

I totally agree that the way sysfs is done is much better than the way
/proc/sys is done today.  Looking at current can be limiting in the
general case.

My current preference is the way /proc/net was done.

The thing is /proc/net is already done.

All I see with making things like /proc/net depend on the context of th=
e
process that called mount is a need to call mount much more often.
