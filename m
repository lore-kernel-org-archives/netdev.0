Yup, I have a patch in works wich defers the ndisc_send_ns call in
rt6_probe into a workqueue out of the call stack. This should solve
the problem.

Still wonder if there is a nicer api as to create a new structure and pass the
arguments via container_of dereferencing to the deferred function (and I
don't think async calls are useable there).
