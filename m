	Problem with process stack? May be some packet loop
happens? Because I can not reproduce such problem in my
virtual setup, I tested TEE too, with careful packet
matching and 1 CPU. Should I assume that you don't have such
oops when the patch is not applied, with the same TEE rule?

	You don't appear to have PREEMPT in above line.
I'm not sure when preemption is enabled if tee_tg6() does
not have a problem with its anti-loop measures (tee_active).
Is preemption possible in OUTPUT hook, i.e. can we change
the CPU while playing with tee_active and as result change
different flag?

Regards
