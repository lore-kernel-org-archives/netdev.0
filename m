I'm a bit late to the party, but...

Ideally, the packets would appear to come from the "inside face" of the
director - usually (and in the most basic case) the NIC with an address
on the same layer 3 network as the real servers. This way the default
route would be ignored as there would normally be a more specific route
for that network, namely straight out of the device the packets arrived
on. Of course, if that coincides with the default gateway address, it'll
still work anyway.

This is the single most compelling thing about this setup.

It's simultaneously a problem in that for (say) an HTTP server, all the
requests will appear to be sourced from the director's internal address.
For many applications this won't be acceptable, not least in that for
the webserver case log processing will be an irrelevance!

Anyone know how the F5 hardware gets around this? I can't get my hands
on any to test...
