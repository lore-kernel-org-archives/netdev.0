This does indeed make it work again for me, thanks!

I only use nfsroot for development, so I don't have a terribly strong
opinion.  I would point out though that the default u-boot parameters
for nfsrooting a lot of boards will no longer work at this point, so if
it's not patched to work again without specifying nfs options I think
there should at least be a note in the documentation and possibly a
"maybe try proto=udp?" console message on failure.

I assume it's not feasable to either wait until the chosen interface's
link is ready before trying to mount nfsroot, or retrying TCP-based
connections a little bit more aggressively/at all?
