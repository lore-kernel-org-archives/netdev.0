Ok that makes sense.

Which seems fine to me too - its an implementation detail of that time
source.

Not only that but consumers of different time synchronizations will need
to be able to describe which time source they want to talk about from a
selection of PTP or similar things.

Something like

	/sys/class/timesource/<name>/...

at which point we don't have to enumerate them all, add special system
calls and then fret about the fact you can't access them from things like
shell scripts.

The fact SYS5.4 Unix and SuS got obsessed with numbering things
rather than using names unlike Unix doesn't mean it's the right model to
number them - usually the reverse is true, a heirarchy of file names is
rather more future proof.
