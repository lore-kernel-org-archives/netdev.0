Ok, thanks for explanation.
I've sent rebased "v2" of the patch set, contains updated patch "SUNRPC=
: handle=20
RPC client pipefs dentries by network namespace aware routine", which, =
I=20
believe, fixes oops, spotted by Bryan (it was caused by excessive call =
of=20
rpc_put_mount() on PipeFS dentries unlink).
So, if I'm not mistaken here, there's no need in implementing of dummy =
versions=20
of rpc_pipefs_notifier_(un)register() or any other dummy stuff.

BTW, it looks like that in last 2 days I've sent all updates to the iss=
ues you=20
pointed out. If not, please, ping me once more.
