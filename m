The Maximum Packet Size (MPS) is of interest for applications which want
to transfer data, so it is only relevant to the data transfer phase of a
connection (unless one wants to send data on the DCCP-Request, but that is
not considered here).

The strategy chosen to deal with this requirement is to leave room for only 
such options that may appear on data packets.

A special consideration applies to Ack Vectors: this is purely guesswork,
since these can have any length between 3 and 1020 bytes. The strategy
chosen here is to subtract a configurable minimum, the value of 16 bytes
(2 bytes for type/length plus 14 Ack Vector cells) has been found by 
experimentatation. If people experience this as too much or too little,
this could later be turned into a Kconfig option.	

There are currently no CCID-specific header options which may appear on data
packets, hence it is not necessary to define a corresponding CCID field.
