	I'm still not sure what is needed. Looking at
ip6_pol_route(), I see that everything should just work: for
routes without RTF_GATEWAY flag we return cloned route
from rt6_alloc_cow() with valid rt6i_gateway. I still
didn't tested the problem myself, so I'll stop with the
comments before that.

	Agreed. I'm not going to test that change. I'll test
latest net-next without any changes to see where exactly is
the failure because the IPv6 routing seems capable for what
we need. I have problems with my setup, so I'll need some
days. As Simon is also testing the problem, he can find the
reason before me.
