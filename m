Hello,

we upgraded the kernel of a nfs-server from 2.6.17.11 to 2.6.22.6. Sinc=
e then we get the message

lockd: too many open TCP sockets, consider increasing the number of nfs=
d threads
lockd: last TCP connect from ^\\236^\=C9^D

1) These random characters in the second line are caused by a bug in sv=
c_tcp_accept.
I already posted this patch on netdev@vger.kernel.org:

with this patch applied one gets something like

lockd: too many open TCP sockets, consider increasing the number of nfs=
d threads
lockd: last TCP connect from 10.11.0.12, port=3D784


2) The number of nfsd threads we are running on the machine is 1024. So=
 this is not
the problem. It seems, though, that in the case of lockd svc_tcp_accept=
 does not
check the number of nfsd threads but the number of lockd threads which =
is one.
As soon as the number of open lockd sockets surpasses 80 this message g=
ets logged.
This usually happens every evening when a lot of people shutdown their =
workstation.

3) For unknown reason these sockets then remain open. In the morning wh=
en people
start their workstation again we therefor not only get a lot of these m=
essages
again but often the nfs-server does not proberly work any more. Restart=
ing the
nfs-daemon is a workaround.

Reagrds,
