Separate patch coming shortly. Will add comment describing the
situation.

It's just fine to use dccp_feat_get_nn_next_val() instead. My primary
reason for creating ccid2_ack_ratio_next() was to keep line lengths
down.

That should also be updated to use dccp_feat_get_nn_next_val(sk,
DCCPF_SEQUENCE_WINDOW)

The problem here is that the ack ratio should only be changed after a
loss, idle period, etc if the new cwnd is going to be less than the
(negotiating) ack ratio. We need to call dccp_feat_get_nn_next_val() to
decide whether we need to adjust the ack ratio or not.

We don't want to change the ack ratio every time we have a loss, etc.
Doing so will result in pointless negotiations and more fluctuations in
the ack ratio, neither of which is desirable.

I'll create a function for this code. Coming in separate patch.

Go ahead with 1) and 2).  I'll send out a new patch for 3 (b) shortly.
