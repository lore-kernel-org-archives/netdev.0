Yes.

Probably not, I guess the sentence was a bit pessimistic.

Also possible. But I guess I was thinking too complicated last night. What 
I was after with the "protect the whole ip_vs_lblc_schedule() with 
write_lock()ing the lock" was also to simply prevent someone adding 
duplicate entries. If we just extend the read_lock() region to cover the 
whole usage of the entry and do an additional duplicate check during 
inserting the entry under write_lock(), we fix the issue and also fix the 
race that someone may add duplicate entries. We have a bit overhead, 
because we unlock/lock and also there is a chance of doing one or more 
useless __ip_vs_wlc_schedule(), but in the end this should work. More 
fine-grained locking could help to lower the impact.
