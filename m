The problem with Ack Vectors is that

  i) their length is variable and can in principle grow quite large,
 ii) it is hard to predict exactly how large they will be.

 Due to the second point it seems not a good idea to reduce the MPS;
i particular when on average there is enough room for the Ack Vector
and an increase in length is momentarily due to some burst loss, after
which the Ack Vector returns to its normal/average length.

The solution taken by this patch to address the outstanding FIXME is
to schedule a separate Sync when running out of space on the skb, and to
log a warning into the syslog.

The mechanism can also be used for other out-of-band signalling: it does
quicker signalling than scheduling an Ack, since it does not need to wait
for new data.

 Additional Note regarding MPS:
 -----------------------------
 It is possible to lower MPS according to the average length of Ack Vectors;
 the following argues why this does not seem to be a good idea.

 When determining the average Ack Vector length, a moving-average is more
 useful than a normal average, since sudden peaks (burst losses) are better
 dampened. The Ack Vector buffer would have a field `av_avg_len' which tracks
 this moving average and MPS would be reduced by this value (plus 2 bytes for
 type/value for each full Ack Vector).

 However, this means that the MPS decreases in the middle of an established
 connection. For a user who has tuned his/her application to work with the
 MPS taken at the beginning of the connection this can be very counter-
 intuitive and annoying.

 (Over the long term there should be some adjustment to reduce MPS at least
  by a minimum when Ack Vectors are used; some applications may rely on the
  exact value of the MPS).
