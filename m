Hi,
I do my test on 3.19.0-rc7 just now, it seems it still doesn't solve th=
e
local-addr-expired problem.

P flag set
Looks like we meet different problems. Here is how I do my test (as wel=
l as on 3.10
+stable):
      Host only
PC <------------> Virtual Machine
create and send a packet using scapy:
-----------------------------------
| IPv6 (src=3DPC-addr, dst=3DVM-addr) |
|---------------------------------|
|     ICMPv6 (Packet Too Big)     |
|---------------------------------|
| IPv6 (src=3DVM-addr, dst=3DVM-addr) |
|---------------------------------|
| ICMPv6 (Neighbor Advertisement) |
-----------------------------------
Then the local-addr is set to expire. After expired, the VM is unreacha=
ble from
PC side.

thanks,
Sheng
