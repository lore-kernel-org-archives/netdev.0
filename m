There's also a '__u8 reserved' field at the beginning of that struct
which could be used. But in general, is it reasonable to expect both
nodes to use the same kernel version, which gets rid of the
extensibility problems? It's not really an ABI that can't be broken,
right?

Yes, without jumping through hoops, we have to probably break the
current protocol anyways for new features? Even if we designated
unused fields for new information, an old kernel will not look at them
/ fill them out, which limits the possibilities...
