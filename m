So, in principle, testing the device should almost make sense. The
device is the container for things like PD's MR's and QP's and those
things can migrate between the ports freely, so all post must share
the same attributes for those items.

However.. AFAIK, we can have RoCEE and IB ports on the same device -
which makes that whole concept seem sort of like nonsense..

Anyhow, I would discourage testing the device. Each site has to be
examined and determine if it working with a single port and really
needs a port attribute (which may be a device attribute today) or if
it is doing something device wide and is checking if all ports support
X.

Well, this is actually a hard job. This isn't a mechanical clean up,
each site has to be inspected and understood before it can be
migrated to the correct API.
