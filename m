I also thought about such a solution but I didn't state it because I th=
ought=20
it is even more hackish than the one below. Mostly because it=20
interleaves "real data" with events (and there is no logical connection=
=20
between the two as opposed to sending scenario). But if it is used in S=
CTP=20
then maybe the whole idea is not that bad...
Anyway, I'll have a look at the documents and at the SCTP implementatio=
n.

The basic idea is the same as above. The difference is that it would ov=
erload=20
ioctl, not recv. But maybe we should use recv. Not because it is in any=
 way=20
better but just because it is already used that way in SCTP and has a f=
ew=20
documents describing the approach.
