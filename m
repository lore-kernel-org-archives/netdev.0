Hi Paolo, thanks for working on this.

All this code looks quite invasive to me ?

Also does inet_diag properly give the forward_alloc to user ?

$ ss -mua
State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port                 Peer Addres
s:Port
UNCONN     51584  0          *:52460      *:*                    
	 skmem:(r51584,rb327680,t0,tb327680,f1664,w0,o0,bl0,d575)


Couldn't we instead use an union of an atomic_t and int for
sk->sk_forward_alloc ?

All udp queues/dequeues would manipulate the atomic_t using regular
atomic ops and use a special skb destructor (instead of sock_rfree())

Also I would not bother 'reclaiming' forward_alloc at dequeue, unless
udp is under memory pressure.

Please share your performance numbers, thanks !
