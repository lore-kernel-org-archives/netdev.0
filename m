Hm, I think you forgot to finish this sentence ;)

Thanks for looking at this, no problem. I know it's a bit much to
digest, but I think there is no smaller part that I could post that is
useful in itself already.

No, those are just exactly what I sent you before. I included them
because I was basing it on net-2.6.

Btw., David just announced that he opened net-next-2.6, so perhaps he
could pull the changes from your tree into that now?

(IPV6 = y || IP_VS = IPV6) means that this option will only be visible
if either CONFIG_IPV6 is set to Y or if both CONFIG_IPV6 and
CONFIG_IP_VS are modules (if both are off, the whole submenu will be
hidden). So CONFIG_IPV6 has to be set at least as high as CONFIG_IP_VS
for this option to be visible.

Yeah, it's broken like this in the original and I kept it like that so
that things would still line up (because I didn't want to add noise by
touching the neighboring lines just for whitespace fixes). I could
just send a small whitespace fix to you before.

Right, that is nicer! With AF_INET6 in that if-condition, of course.
