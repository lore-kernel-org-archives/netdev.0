	No, there should be no problem with the interface,
it already uses 32 bits. We should change only cp->flags
to 32 bits and new flags should go after bit 16 if they
are not needed for sync. Some flags can be changed safely,
for example, IP_VS_CONN_F_SYNC: it is not used by ipvsadm,
it is set only in backup, so it can be moved after bit 16.
May be another idea is to create 2nd version for the
struct ip_vs_sync_conn to support more features.
