What you proposed in the patch should work ok for qpolicies for now. Bu=
t=20
sooner or later the need to add a field to struct dccp_skb_cb will aris=
e. So=20
maybe we should think about it now...
Other possibility apart from what you proposed in the patch is creating=
 struct=20
dccp_skb_cb_ext, move to it some fields from struct dccp_skb_cb and in =
struct=20
add a pointer to this new struct dccp_skb_cb_ext. Ok, maybe it is not t=
he=20
prettiest idea but in case somebody needs yet another additional field =
in=20
struct dccp_skb_cb_ext it would be nice to have an idea how to do it.

While we are developing in the test tree compatibility is not important=
 at=20
all. But real world needs compatibility, especially if it's not that=20
expensive. Otherwise people will get weird behaviour without any messag=
es=20
indicating what is wrong. And it's certainly not how code should be wri=
tten.=20
It can't be that binary package of VLC (or any other streaming server) =
cannot=20
use newer kernel version because we added a new field.

Putting any of those values in an integer is pretty straightforward. Bu=
t when=20
you want to put both timeout and priority things get messy. Would it be=
=20
possible at least to use structure like that:
struct dccp_packet_info
{
	s8	priority;
	u16	timeout_mantissa:10;
	u16	timeout_exponent:6;
}
? That would still fit in 32-bit integer (so could be stored in=20
skb->priority), but would provide a much cleaner interface.
