Right.

Personally I'd make it a lower priority--I don't see why you can't make
4.1 a requirement for the new transport--but I'd be curious what others
have to say.

Off the top of my head I can't remember where else that's used in the
protocol other than in setting up the 4.0 callback connection (and in
rpcbind).

As far as I can tell, 1831 claims to be independent of any transport
protocol details: "The RPC protocol can be implemented on several
different transport protocols.  The RPC protocol does not care how a
message is passed from one process to another, but only with
specification and interpretation of messages."  And: "When RPC messages
are passed on top of a byte stream transport protocol (like TCP)"....
So perhaps there's nothing more to say here.

Anyay, if there is anything to be worked out, nfsv4@ietf.org is the
place to go.
