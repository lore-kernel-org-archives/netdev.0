So we could disable the size checks of the passed structs, or key on it to 
determine if the older ABI was used, keeping a list of the structs that 
had different sizes around, but that sounds like a gross hack which would 
get worse if any other fields are added.  It would also mean new userspace 
binaries with the new fields wouldn't work with older kernels, is that a 
problem?  Is this better than the alternatives of breaking the ABI, or 
duplicating code into a separate ABI?
