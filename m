But the reason we get to this code is because there was a report of
space collision.  What would you suggest instead?  Changing
xs_{tcp,udp}_send_request() to retry in this case would defeat the point
of having xs_nospace().

What should happen is the request getting re-queued to run at the next
available opportunity, rather than perhaps sleeping for a certain length
of time.  At the moment, leaving SOCK_ASYNC_NOSPACE unset causes the
request to never be woken, whereas setting that bit seems to always be
re-queued at some near point in the future.
