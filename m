Hi Dave,

can you please consider the following DCCP set of patches. It is a
self-contained set for feature negotiation among endpoints.

These have been tested over a long period in the test tree. 

The set contains the same patches as submitted to netdev/dccp@vger last week.
Thanks to contributions from several people, this revised set contains several
improvements. I have just verified that the set is still fully bisectable.

The set can be pulled from

	git://eden-feed.erg.abdn.ac.uk/net-next-2.6 	[subtree `master']

which uses a fresh net-next-2.6 from today, also compile-tested.

A summary is below, changes can be viewed online at
	http://eden-feed.erg.abdn.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=net-next-2.6.git

- Gerrit

Part I - Basis
---------------
Patch #1: Provides the basic datastructure for feature negotiation. It gets 
          around the problem that feature-negotiation values have no uniform
	  type - they can be 48-bit numbers, single characters, 2-byte integers
	  or a list of unsigned chars.
Patch #2: Provides a lookup-table for the different negotiable features.
Patch #3: Adds list management for the list keeping the negotiation-options.
Patch #4: Initialisation routines (for request sockets and normal sockets).
Patch #5: Analogous to #4, this provides the cleanup routines.	  
Patch #6: Changes the existing policy to allow anytime changes as that lead
          to unpredictable results.
Patch #7: Adds registration routines. These form part of the user interface
          and are later used by the socket API to set individual preferences.
Patch #8: CCIDs are a negotiable feature. This patch adds support to query the
          supported CCIDs, so as to advertise only the locally supported ones.
Patch #9: The choice of CCID in turn creates new feature dependencies. The patch
          adds automatic tracking of such dependencies to avoid later failure.

Part II - Core	  
--------------
Patch #10: Provides a mechanism to then resolve CCID-dependent features. Since
           CCIDs are a server-priority feature, this is done by the server.
Patch #11: Deprecates old featneg API, as it was dangerous/clumsy.
Patch #12: Support to negotiate checksum-coverage values (as in UDP-Lite).
Patch #13: Deprecates Ack Ratio sysctl, to enable automatic updating.
Patch #14: Tidies up the setsockopt interface for new additions.
Patch #15: Set/getsockopt support to negotiate CCIDs with the peer.
Patch #16: Socket API to query the current CCID from userspace.
Patch #17: Prepares the variable-length htonl/ntohl functions for 48 bits.
           Such a length is needed by e.g. the Sequence Window feature.
Patch #18: Support for DCCP `Mandatory' type options (RFC 4340, 5.8.2).
Patch #19: Routine to insert feature-negotiation header options.
Patch #20: Complements #19, to add feature-negotiation options onto the skb.
Patch #21: Complements #20 and completes the insertion of featneg options.
Patch #22: Logic/algorithm to actually reconcile negotiation options.
Patch #23: Receiver support to process incoming Change L/R options. 
Patch #24: Receiver support to process incoming Confirm R/L options.
Patch #25: Handlers for activating successfully negotiated features.

Part III - Integration and cleanup
----------------------------------
Patch #26: Integration of dynamic negotiation, part I (socket setup).
Patch #27: Integration of dynamic negotiation, part II (server side).
Patch #28: Integration of dynamic negotiation, part III (client side).

Patch #29: Cleans up the older infrastructure.
Patch #30: Removes obsolete parts of the old CCID interface.
Patch #31: Removes manual intervention on NDP count (now automatic).
Patch #32: Removes Ack Vector sysctl (handled automatically now).

Patch #33: Initialisation framework for the supported features.
Patch #34: Auto-loading of CCID modules so that the modules are available
           when the negotiation is completed.
Patch #35: Adds full support for local/remote Sequence Window.
Patch #36: Initialisation and type-checking of involved sysctls.
Patch #37: A set of (useful) debugging/printing helper functions.
