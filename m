Its really a corner case. In practice protocol modules don't have reall=
y
long names. And if one was merged that did, the buffer size could be in=
creased
at that time.

So while I think its reasonable to protect against something unexpected
in a protocol-module name crashing the system. Especially as that
can be achieved without any real overhead. I don't think we need
to sanitise the output.
