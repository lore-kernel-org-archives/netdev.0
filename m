Even with dhcp server, we get the same log for rootpath. It never
appears over there.

The nfs work fine when you use the dhcp server, but still it is a
totally different proposition. The problem comes when we assign a static
IP in the bootargs, and then try to boot the system using NFS. here is
the bootargs setting at the u-boot.

bootargs = console=ttyAMA0,115200 mem=128M root=/dev/nfs
nfsroot=192.168.1.1:/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/devkit/arm/target
ip=192.168.1.10:192.168.1.1:192.168.1.1:255.255.255.0::eth0

These settings have been working fine for earlier kernels. The tcp dump
while doing the nfs boot is quite different between the 2.6.32 and
2.6.37 kernels.
