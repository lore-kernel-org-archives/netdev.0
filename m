They may be obsolete, but they're still in the kernel, and they aren't
copied to userspace, so we can mark them.

Patch 1 is to allow for things to mark their whitelists. Patch 30
disables the full whitelisting, since then we've defined them all, so
the kmalloc caches need to mark themselves as whitelisted.

Patch 1 leaves unmarked things whitelisted so we can progressively
tighten the restriction and have a bisectable series. (i.e. if there
is something wrong with one of the whitelists in the series, it will
bisect to that one, not the one that removes the global whitelist from
patch 1.)
