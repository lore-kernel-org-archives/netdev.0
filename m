I know it's a minor point, but look at tcp_ipv6.c:

         if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_IP))
                 return tcp_v4_conn_request(sk, skb);

That's different from the code you quoted that's doing an assignment. 
__constant_htons() isn't used anywhere in an if() statement, although I 
did find a couple in the bonding driver that should be fixed.
