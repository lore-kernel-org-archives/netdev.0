Hi Julian,

thanks for spotting this bits issue.

On the kernel-side of things, internally it should be easy
enough to either expand flags or add a new element to the structure.
So it seems to me that the problem is the kernel/user-space interface.
And if that is the case, I think the best idea is to just use
the netlink interface for all new configuration options and have
new features unsupported through the old, legacy, ioctl interface.
