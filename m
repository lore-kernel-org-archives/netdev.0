	May be, I'll check it again, for now I see only
rcu_read_lock() in nf_hook_slow() which is preemptable.
Looking at rcu_preempt_note_context_switch, many levels of
RCU locks are preemptable too.

	In my test I used link route to local subnet,
--gateway to IP that is not present. I'll try other
variants.

	Yes, this patch is ok and after spending the whole
saturday I'm preparing a new patch that will convert
rt6_nexthop() to return just rt6i_gateway, without daddr.
This can happen after filling rt6i_gateway in all places.

	For your concern for loopback, I don't see problem,
local/anycast route will have rt6i_gateway=IP, they are
simple DST_HOST routes. I'm preparing now the patches and
will post them in following hours.
