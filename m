It gets even more interesting. When I unmount the directory, the hidden
port does not go away. It is still there. But if I mount it again, it
goes away (until it times out again).

Even more info:

When I first mount it, it creates 3 sockets, where one immediately is
closed:

tcp        0      0 192.168.23.9:892        192.168.23.22:44672     TIME_WAIT   -

tcp        0      0 192.168.23.9:754        192.168.23.22:44672     ESTABLISHED -                   

(192.168.23.22 is the machine remotely mounting a directory from the
server 192.168.23.9)

The trace of port 892 is this:

That "2049" port is what is used for all transferring of data.

When the FIN/ACK is sent by the client, the socket is destroyed (no more connections
can be used) but the port is not freed up, because it appears there's still an owner
attached to it. That means this port will *never* be used again. Even if the client
unmount the directory. That port is still in limbo.

When the FIN/ACK comes in, it goes into the TIME_WAIT state here:

Then eventually, the socket is freed, and 'netstat' no longer shows it.

"empty=0" means the tb->owners associated with the port is not empty, and the
freeing of the port is skipped.

Now when I go and remount the directory from the client, the code finally cleans
up the port:

Notice that "empty=1" now, and the port is freed.

And 688 will be the port that becomes the new hidden port.

Thus it looks like there's something that is not cleaning up ports properly. There's
some timing issues here.

Any thoughts why. Because this is obviously wrong, and not only is it wasting a port
and memory to store it, but it's causing rkhunter to report it, because it's one of
the things that rootkits do.
