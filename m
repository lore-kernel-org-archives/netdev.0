Hi Sven,

I need to look over these changes with a fresh set of eyes in the morning
- sorry that I didn't do that earlier today.  I am very much in favour of
the changes that we made last week, and this patch at least looks a lot
like the changes we discussed.  Do you think these should be pushed
into 2.6.27? Or perhaps even stable? They are real races, right?
