Yes, a sender-based implementation seems really complicated, mainly in
principle.

I understand now the issue, thanks. Isn't better to just send the RTT e=

to the sender, as the RFC says?

Isn't it 50% chance at each ecn verified? So, at the end we'll end up w=

I have doubts either. This seems to be too complicated and not much use=

Yes, we can work more with a simpler implementation at the receiver
side and focus
on performance and test, and features too. After, we have a stable
version and good enough in performance terms,
=A0we can continue improving the sender side.

I agree. It's a risk to work on the sender at the moment, implementing
these features,
algorithms and ending with a CCID that doesn't match the expected perfo=
rmance.
Can you list the pending tasks in both code and tests to be done?
