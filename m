+Mounting the root filesystem via Ceph (cephroot)
+===============================================
+
+Written 2013 by Rob Taylor <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>
+
+derived from nfsroot.txt:
+
+Written 1996 by Gero Kuhlmann <gero@gkminix.han.de>
+Updated 1997 by Martin Mares <mj@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>
+Updated 2006 by Nico Schottelius <nico-kernel-nfsroot@schottelius.org>
+Updated 2006 by Horms <horms@verge.net.au>
+
+
+
+In order to use a diskless system, such as an X-terminal or printer server
+for example, it is necessary for the root filesystem to be present on a
+non-disk device. This may be an initramfs (see Documentation/filesystems/
+ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt), a ramdisk (see Documentation/initrd.txt), a
+filesystem mounted via NFS or a filesystem mounted via Ceph. The following
+text describes on how to use Ceph for the root filesystem.
+
+For the rest of this text 'client' means the diskless system, and 'server'
+means the Ceph server.
+
+
+1.) Enabling cephroot capabilities
+    -----------------------------
+
+In order to use cephroot, CEPH_FS needs to be selected as
+built-in during configuration. Once this has been selected, the cephroot
+option will become available, which should also be selected.
+
+In the networking options, kernel level autoconfiguration can be selected,
+along with the types of autoconfiguration to support. Selecting all of
+DHCP, BOOTP and RARP is safe.
+
+
+2.) Kernel command line
+    -------------------
+
+When the kernel has been loaded by a boot loader (see below) it needs to be
+told what root fs device to use. And in the case of cephroot, where to find
+both the server and the name of the directory on the server to mount as root.
+This can be established using the following kernel command line parameters:
+
+root=/dev/ceph
+
+This is necessary to enable the pseudo-Ceph-device. Note that it's not a
+real device but just a synonym to tell the kernel to use Ceph instead of
+a real device.
+
+If cephroot is not specified, it is expected that that a valid mount will be
+found via DHCP option 17, Root Path [1]
+
+cephroot=<monaddrs>:/[<subdir>],<ceph-opts>
+
+  <monaddrs>    Monitor addresses separated by commas. Each takes the form
+		host[:port]. If the port is not specified, the Ceph default
+		of 6789 is assumed.
+
+  <subdir>	A subdirectory subdir may be specified if a subset of the file
+		system is to be mounted
+
+  <ceph-opts>	Standard Ceph options. All options are separated by commas.
+		See Documentation/filesystems/ceph/ceph.txt for options and
+		their defaults.

+  cephroot was derived from nfsroot by Rob Taylor <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>
+  and Mark Doffman <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>
+
+  The nfsroot code in the kernel and the RARP support have been written
+  by Gero Kuhlmann <gero@gkminix.han.de>.
+
+  The rest of the IP layer autoconfiguration code has been written
