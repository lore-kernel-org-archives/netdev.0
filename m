Thanks for the note, I will fix that.

Yes, that's the easiest solution and it doesn't really cost you
anything besides the slightly bigger allocation.

It should follow the same semantics as with dumps. Netlink is typically
used in an object context, where objects are requested, added or deleted. 
Basically, a dump is a request to fill the userspace listening part with
all objects of the specified type. genetlink is a bit special as it
moved away from the traditional 4 commands per family (get, new, set,
delete) but in a case like IPVS where you are in fact managing objects
it does make sense to stick to the known semantics.
