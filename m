Hi,

Firstly, please don't reply to emails unless you are actually
replying to the topic at hand. Instead just compose a fresh
message to the people/lists that you want to address.
This helps keep threads in mail-readers that support them sane.

In any case this question would be better sent to the lvs-users list.

But to your question.

These schedulers are described briefly in the ipvsadm(8) man page
and in pseudo code in the source files (ip_vs_lblc.c and ip_vs_lblcr.c)
in the Linux kernel tree. And there is some discussion in the howto
http://www.austintek.com/LVS/LVS-HOWTO/HOWTO/LVS-HOWTO.ipvsadm.html#DH

The way that I think of these schedulers is as enhanced versions of wlc
designed for use with transparent proxies. That is situations where
there will be a lot of destination addresses.

lblc works by keeping a cache that associates destination addresses with
a real server. This allows accesses, potentially from different end-users,
to be sent to the same real-server. As this is designed to be used
with proxies, this means the request will be sent to a proxy that may
have already retrieved the result.

lblcr is similar, but instead of one real-server per destination, it
allows for multiple real-servers per destination.
