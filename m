Yes that is possible, since in this case the host has not registered any
preferences, which means that either
 * only the first value is used
 * or negotiation is done against the default value.

Checking only the first value also gives a bit more robustness. I have
changed this and will send the full diff after testing and uploading. 
Thanks again.
