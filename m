Hi all,

I think there has been a change in the net/sunrpc code introduced with 

commit 9cbc94fb06f98de0e8d393eaff09c790f4c3ba46

    SUNRPC: Remove TCP socket linger code

    Now that we no longer use the partial shutdown code when closing the
    socket, we no longer need to worry about the TCP linger2 state.

    Signed-off-by: Trond Myklebust <trond.myklebust@primarydata.com>

which has caused some regressions removing the functionality which was mentioned 
in the email thread I have attached below.

We have exactly the same use case as the one in the email thread. We call
    __set_bit(NFS_CS_DISCRTRY, &clp->cl_flags)
also in NSFv3

which means we have been relying on the lingering_timeout code to disconnect
and be able to reconnect quickly if the client IP suddenly changes.

As we stand, before moving to 4.4. kernel, where lingering_timeout functionality 
has been removed, we were able to talk again with the NFSv3 share in 60 + 15 seconds
(XS_TCP_LINGER_TO = 15 seconds) while now, after the commit above,  
we need 60 + 924 seconds.

This is because we are keeping the global /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retries2 = 15 as it is by 
default and we would not want to risk to change it to something else.

I have two questions:

1) Can we say removing the lingering_timeout functionality caused a regression?
2) Is there any way this could be fixed reintroducing it or putting a new mechanism in place
so we can talk to the share using a new connection before the previous (with the old IP) times
out with tcp_retries2 after 15 minutes?

Please have a look at the thread I have included below and let me know what do you think
about this problem.

If you can recommend a way you would like this to be addressed, I would be happy to 
contribute a patch.

Thanks everyone,

Stefano

The difference between these timestamps is 27 seconds, which is a lot less
than the "20 minutes" that you quote.  That seems odd.

If you adjust
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retries2

you can reduce the current timeout.
See Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt for details on the setting.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt

It claims the default gives an effective timeout of 924 seconds or about 15
minutes.

I just tried and the timeout was 1047 seconds. This is probably the next
retry after 924 seconds.

If I reduce tcp_retries2 to '3' (well below the recommended minimum) I get
a timeout of 5 seconds.
You can possibly find a suitable number that isn't too small...

Alternately you could use NFSv4.  It will close the connection on a timeout.
In the default config I measure a 78 second timeout, which is probably more
acceptable.  This number would respond to the timeo mount option.
If I set that to 100, I get a 28 second timeout.

The same effect could be provided for NFSv3 by setting:

           __set_bit(NFS_CS_DISCRTRY, &clp->cl_flags);

somewhere appropriate.  I wonder why that isn't being done for v3 already...
Probably some subtle protocol difference.
