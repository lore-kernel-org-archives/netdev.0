No, I meant that whether or not you saw an error message, the  
underlying condition probably was not occurring before 2.6.30.

The NFS client and server appear to start lockd listeners for NFSv4.   
They probably don't need to.  But that's a separate issue.

In this case, it looks like the message can be treated as a notice.  I  
think in general we could safely make that a dprintk, but I'd like to  
wait a bit more to see if we catch any bad behavior.
