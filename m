Personally I would never use a GET id to send any data at all. My main
focus is on trying to make message protocols self documenting. If a
certain message type has multiple meanings depending on the direction
it will make it harder to understand and harder to debug from a protocol
standpoint.

The common netlink semantics are

 CMD_OBJ_NEW - create or update objects as described in the message
               content.
 CMD_OBJ_SET - rarely used, update a static object which doesn't have
               to be created or added. asme as OBJ_NEW otherwise.
 CMD_OBJ_DEL - delete object described in the message
 CMD_OBJ_GET - search for a object as described in the message and
               send a CMD_OBJ_NEW as reply including the full object.

	       with NLM_F_DUMP: iterate over all objects and send a
	       CMD_OBJ_NEW for each object. This request often carries
	       no additional data.

It's pretty simple but covers almost every possible protocol for use
in configuration interfaces. In the case of IPVS_CMD_GET_INFO the
actual data being sent back can be regarded as a info object. Basically
netlink is mainly used as a very basic form of rpc.
