I'm confused, possibly because there are three "sockets" here: the
client-side socket that's connected, the server-side socket that's
bound, and the common object that exists in the filesystem namespace.

Userland creates the server-side socket and binds to it.  All of that i=
s
done in the context of the rpcbind process, so is created in rpcbind's
namespace.  That should be OK, right?

The client side socket is created and connected in
xs_local_setup_socket().

Making sure they both end up with the same thing is a matter of making
sure they lookup the same path in the same namespace.  The difficult
part of that is the in-kernel client-side socket connect, where we don'=
t
have the right process context any more.

We currently set that up with __sock_create followed by
kernel_connect.

The proposal seems to be to instead do an openat followed by a
kernel_connect, and pass the path in the openat instead of the connect.

(Though in the kernel we won't be able to call openat, so we'll end up
doing something like nfsd does (calling lookup_one_len() and
dentry_open() by hand).)

Have I got all that right?

I don't know if that's better just calling into the unix socket code at
connect time as your patch does.  Maybe the answer depends on whether
it's a priority to make this functionality available to userspace.

--b.
