See my earlier point about "quite a lot of state to pass". But if this

static __init void
test_string_escape_overflow(const char *in, int p, char *out_real, int out_size,
			    unsigned int flags, const char *esc, int q_test,
			    const char *name)
{
	int q_real;

	memset(out_real, 'Z', out_size);
	q_real = string_escape_mem(in, p, out_real, 0, flags, esc);
	if (q_real != q_test)
		pr_warn("Test '%s' failed: flags = %u, osz = 0, expected %d, got %d\n",
			name, flags, q_test, q_real);
	if (memchr_inv(out_real, 'Z', out_size))
		pr_warn("Test '%s' failed: osz = 0 but string_escape_mem wrote to the buffer\n",
			name);
}

is what you want, sure, have it your way.

I need to fix fs/proc/array.c in 3/3 as well, to make the kernel
compile+boot and make the series bisectable. Before I send v4 please let
me know what you think about this (the minimal fix I could come up with):

diff --git a/fs/proc/array.c b/fs/proc/array.c
index 1295a00ca316..20f2d50e2dba 100644
--- a/fs/proc/array.c
+++ b/fs/proc/array.c
@@ -99,10 +99,9 @@ static inline void task_name(struct seq_file *m, struct task_struct *p)
        buf = m->buf + m->count;
 
        /* Ignore error for now */
-       string_escape_str(tcomm, &buf, m->size - m->count,
-                         ESCAPE_SPACE | ESCAPE_SPECIAL, "\n\\");
+       m->count += string_escape_str(tcomm, buf, m->size - m->count,
+                                     ESCAPE_SPACE | ESCAPE_SPECIAL, "\n\\");
 
-       m->count = buf - m->buf;
        seq_putc(m, '\n');
 }
 
[Longer-term I think it would be a lot better not to poke around in
the internals of struct seq_file. One way is to do the escaping into a
stack buffer (2*sizeof(p->comm) should be enough) and then use something
like seq_write(m, buffer, min(sizeof(buffer),
return-value-from-string_escape_str)).

Another option is to do everything with a single seq_printf call,
something like

seq_printf(m, "Name:\t%*pEcs\n, (int)strlen(tcomm), tcomm)

That will escape more than just \ and \n, but that would IMO be an
improvement. But of course this is out of scope for this series.]
