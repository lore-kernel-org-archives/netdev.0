Right, I did not touch nfs4_callback_up_net(), only
nfs41_callback_up_net().

If I'm reading the code right NFSv4 uses a separate listen port for the
backchannel instead of sharing the client's socket?

This is possible to implement with AF_VSOCK but I have only tested
NFSv4.1 so far.  Should I go ahead and do this?

Yes, I ignored rpcbind and didn't test NFSv2/v3.

I am not familiar with the standards process but I came across a few
places where it makes sense to have a standard:

 * SUNRPC netid for AF_VSOCK (currently "tcp", "udp", and others exist)
 * The uaddr string format ("vsock:...")
 * Use of RFC 1831 record fragments (just like TCP) over AF_VSOCK
   SOCK_STREAM sockets

These are all at the SUNRPC level rather than at the NFS protocol level.

Any idea who I need to talk to?

No, this will require kernel and libpcap patches.  Something like
drivers/net/nlmon.c is needed for AF_VSOCK.  Basically a dummy network
interface and code that clones skbs when monitoring is enabled.

It's on the TODO list and will be very useful.

Yes, exactly.  It works since the TCP and AF_VSOCK streams are almost
bit-compatible.  I think the difference between the streams occurs when
network addresses are transmitted (e.g. SUNRPC netids), but I haven't
encountered that with NFSv4.1 and no pnfs or fancy features in use.

I have been testing nfsd on the host and nfs client in a virtual
machine.  Vice versa should work in the same way.

It's also possible to run nfsd in VM #1 and nfs client in VM #2 and use
the netcat-like utility on the host to forward the traffic.  That way
any kernel panic happens in a VM and doesn't bring down the machine.
I'll probably begin using this approach when I start nfsd work.

Thanks!  If anyone has suggestions to avoid adding the AF_VSOCK
transport I'd be interested to learn about that.
