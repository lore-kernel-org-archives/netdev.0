To have ip6_dst_check working, there must to be a valid link from
the rt6_info to the fib6_node. Otherwise we cannot check the serial
number. As I currently see we also need a link from the fib6_node down
to the dst entry for resource management. Thus we would have to insert
the special dst-entry with RTF_GATEWAY and non-null rt6i_gateway back
into the fib and have it globally visible. This could have unforseen
side effects. We still cache all dst entries in the fib. One think I
foresee as a possible problem is the automatic aggregation of ECMP routes,
too.

IPv4 does not seem to need this link at all.

Ok, I see.

We should provide something similar to what IPv4 does with the
KNOWN_NH flag. I guess my idea with exchanging rt6i_dst as nexthop would
solve this without too much hassle but this would have to be checked by
implementing it.

I don't think that storing a changed nexthop in the ipv6 cb is that nice and
maintainable.
