It seems tables are processed with bh disabled, so no preemption while
recursing. So I guess the use of tee_active is safe for breaking the
tie here.

The reason I exhaust stack space is that we can actually send out packets
while looking up routes (rt6_probe). The nonreachability of the default
gateway and the to-teed-to box does the rest.

We need to change the route lookup of the duplicated packet in xt_tee to not
cause ndisc probes to be generated.

The more I review the patch the more I think it is ok. But we could actually
try to just always return rt6i_gateway, as we should always be handed a cloned
rt6_info where the gateway is already filled in, no?

Greetings,

  Hannes
