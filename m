Well, since at least one person that has contributed significantly in
the past has said he can't cope with traffic on netdev, we can CC
dccp@vger.kernel.org.

I have performed basic tests, and when doing so noticed a bug in
inet_diag, that I commented with Herbert Xu and he has since provided a
fix.

Being posted and re-posted does not guarantee that the patch is OK or
that is in a form that is acceptable to all tree maintainers. DaveM is
subscribed to dccp@vger and could have picked this if he had the time to
do the review. I didn't, but now I'm trying to spend my time on
reviewing your patches and in the process doing modifications I find
appropriate while trying hard not to introduce bugs in your hard work
to get it merged.

Fair enough, I will do that before asking Herbert or Dave to pull from
my tree.

Sorry for not point out exactly this, here it goes:

Your original patch:

+int tfrc_rx_hist_init(struct tfrc_rx_hist *h)
+{
+	int i;
+
+	for (i = 0; i <= NDUPACK; i++) {
+		h->ring[i] = kmem_cache_alloc(tfrc_rxh_cache, GFP_ATOMIC);
+		if (h->ring[i] == NULL)
+			return 1;
+	}
+	h->loss_count = 0;
+	h->loss_start = 0;
+	return 0;
+}
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(tfrc_rx_hist_init);

Then, in ccid3_hc_rx_init you do:

static int ccid3_hc_rx_init(struct ccid *ccid, struct sock *sk)
{
        struct ccid3_hc_rx_sock *hcrx = ccid_priv(ccid);

        ccid3_pr_debug("entry\n");

        hcrx->ccid3hcrx_state = TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA;
        tfrc_lh_init(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_li_hist);
        return tfrc_rx_hist_init(&hcrx->ccid3hcrx_hist);
}

So if tfrc_rx_hist_init fail to allocate, say, the last entry in the
ring, it will return 1, and from looking at how you initialize
h->loss_{count,start} to zero I assumed that the whole tfrc_rx_hist
is not zeroed when tfrc_rx_hist_init is called, so one can also assume
that the ring entries are not initialized to NULL and that if the
error recovery is to assume that later on tfrc_rx_hist_cleanup is called
we would not have a leak, but an OOPS when tfrc_rx_hist_cleanup tries
to call kfree_cache_free on the uninitialized ring entries.

But if you look at ccid_new(), that calls ccid3_hc_rx_init(), you'll see
that when the ccid rx or hx routine fails, it just frees the
struct ccid with the area where h->ring is, so, what was not cleaned up
by the ccid init routine is effectively forgot, leaked.

I first did the cleanup at tfrc_rx_hist_init (that I renamed to
tfrc_rx_hist_alloc, since it doesn't just initializes things, but
allocates entries from slab), but then I just made the rx history slab
have arrays of tfrc_rx_hist_entry objects, not individual ones as your
code always allocates them as arrays.

good

Let me check now and tell you for sure:

tfrc_rx_hist_delta_seqno and tfrc_rx_hist_swap were not included, as
they were not used, we should introduce them later, when getting to the
working on the loss interval code.

I hadn't considered that tfrc_ewma would for every packet check if the
avg was 0 and I find it suboptimal now that I look at it, we are just
feeding data packets, no? So checking just when we are at
TFRC_RSTATE_NO_DATA, as your code does seems to be better, but not by
calling ccid3_hc_rx_update_s, but just doing:

<SNIP>
	{
                do_feedback = CCID3_FBACK_INITIAL;
                ccid3_hc_rx_set_state(sk, TFRC_RSTATE_DATA);
                hcrx->ccid3hcrx_s = payload_size;
	}
<SNIP>

	And we also just do test for len > 0 in update_s, that looks like
also excessive, no? As we should pass just data packets, perhaps we should
just do a BUG_ON there.

Understood, consider this one then an optimization and not a bugfix. My
motivation to add this as an optimization had I realized that tfrc_ewma
checks for avg being zero would have been greatly diminished, but since
we are having all this discussion, I think the optimization is
OK to have merged.

Gerrit, I do these kinds of code reorganizations on the core Linux
networking for ages, I'm not perfect (huh! :-P) but I also didn't
performed extensive testing doing coverage analisys of all the
imaginable possibilities, just did my best to improve the abstractions
and the code, ocasionally fixing bugs as I went thru the existing code.

So while I understand your concerns about being careful, rest asured I
_am_ careful and will be even _more_ careful by using the regression
tests you mentioned, as it would be a shame not to use them.

But I can't just take your patches as-is all the time, I have my
personal preferences and will try to use them when taking the time to
merge code from anyone.

Its not like that, you released your code as GPL, its out there, it
would be a shame not to merge it, but not as-is all the time. I'm making
sure I stick my name when I do major code changes while giving you due
credit for your work.

And heck, this was an [RFC], I didn't pushed this upstream before
listening to your concerns. Its only fair that if you expect me to
review your work, I should expect for you to review my work, even more
when is to improve yours.

Best Regards,
