Yeah, and it's not an ABI, it's a very specialized protocol between
two kernels, so the rules are less clear. However, I totally agree
with you that it's not convenient from the users' point of view.

He :) Imagine an old kernel on the backup receiving new messages and
not understanding them. How could we at least handle that situation
gracefully (without totally confusing the older kernel)? We'd need to
do it in a way that old features are still communicated in the same
way. E.g., v4-only connection syncs still use the same message format,
but once you use v6 entries, an unused flag or the 'reserved' field in
ip_vs_sync_conn is used. A v6 message would still confuse an older
kernel then, but a user would already notice that ipvsadm can't
configure the v6 services on the older kernel, so that's not too bad.

Anyways, these are just some thoughts. I'm unsure if we really need to
worry about this extension right now or if we could postpone it? At
least for me, it makes more sense to clean up the minimal set of IPv6
features first and then think about the more advanced/optional ones,
like the sync daemon.
