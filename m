I think from an operational (ie. end user) perspective, ABI breakage is
something to try to avoid but _not_ at all costs.

If it's possible to extend the sync daemon protocol by reusing the
existing code and ABI, all well and good; however if a fundamental
change is made which breaks the old sync daemon ABI then as long as it's
documented and we make sure that users know to have the same (or higher)
kernel versions on their directors then everyone wins.

I guess that as and when this change is made and gets into mainline
releases, Joe and I will have to have a mantra of "ensure your directors
are using the same kernel version" in response to queries on
lvs-users :)
