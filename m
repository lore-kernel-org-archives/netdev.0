	May be it is possible, eg. by adding more
arguments to __ip_vs_get_out_rt and moving all dst
checks and icmp_send there. But there are some dst
checks specific to the forwarding method, so I'm not
sure in the end result yet.

	For IPVS, noref is always possible because the
dst_cache var holds reference, even for the NOCACHE case
which is more likely to occur. So, some new variant of
skb_dst_set_noref that supports NOCACHE without dst_hold
is still needed.
