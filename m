Aww, I was hoping that patch would work.  It still seemed to fix some issues for me when mounting multiple servers, so I'm planning to keep it.  Unfortunately I'm out of town this week, so I haven't had much of a chance to keep poking at this issue.  I should be able to get back to it next week!

Thanks for the update!
