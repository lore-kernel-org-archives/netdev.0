Hmm,  
I'm not sure if the IP_VS_WAIT_WHILE() in ip_vs_flush is a good idea in this case...
That was why I wrote ip_vs_service_cleanup()

OK I will try to do that, both with and without throttle in ip_vs_in()

Yes

Exactly,
I have already done that in my next patch,  and some other small changes :-)
For the ip_vs.ko there is only one register/unregister now, the schedulers still have their own.
Hopefully the patch is ready to morrow
