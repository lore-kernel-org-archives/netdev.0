 	Yes, I think we should check for !skb_is_gso(skb)
as it looks as correct check to avoid FRAG_NEEDED after GRO
but lets wait for confirmation from Herbert Xu.
Also, !skb->local_df check should help for local IPVS clients
that set local_df.

 	If you prefer you can create such helper in ip_vs_xmit.c:

/* Check if packet exceeds MTU */
static inline int ip_vs_mtu_exceeded(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int mtu)
{
 	return skb->len > mtu && !skb_is_gso(skb) && !skb->local_df;
}
