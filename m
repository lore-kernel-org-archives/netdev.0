Oh, sorry, you are right. It happens with an unpatched net-next  kernel, too.

I inserted the TEE rule in mangel/OUTGOING and had only one route, ip -6 r a
default via fe80::1 dev eth0 which at the time of the panic was actually not
reachable.

Hm, maybe. I don't have too much insight into netfilter stack and
what are the differences between OUTPUT and FORWARD path but plan to
investigate. ;)

Anyways just wanted to let you know that unpatched kernels are affected, too.
Will have a closer look later.
