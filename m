I think the test for NN features should be added back in. If we allow
the function to be called for non-NN features, we need to include more
code to return the correct values for non-NN features. In either the
negotiating or non-negating state, the current code will return bad
values for non-NN features.

Further, since non-NN features are indeterminate until we receive the
confirm, I don't see that a get_ function for those features would ever
be useful.

A shorter name is probably a good idea. dccp_feat_nn_get() seems fine.

The patch you attached looks fine.

The additional calls to dccp_nn_get_next_val() are made just before we
call ccid2_change_l_ack_ratio() when we have a loss, idle period, or
application limited period.=20

These are the sections of code that you recommended become a separate
patch. I have re-factored that code slightly to reduce code duplication
and will send out that patch immediately after this email.

Right now, Change's are sent on every packet until the matching Confirm
is received. That will be the cause of most of the Change's you are
seeing.

The other thing is that at the beginning of a connection the sequence
window will be reduced and then increased. The initial window of 100
packets is too wide for 5*cwnd at the start of the connection. So the
window will be reduced as low as it will go at the very beginning of the
connection. However, as slow start picks up, cwnd will increase and the
sequence window will as well.

I've seen the above behavior, but haven't thought of an effective
solution (nor am I sure that we need a solution). Capping the minimum
sequence window at the default (100 packets) would solve this, but that
doesn't seem like a great solution.

I'm not entirely certain what low_threshold and high_threshold you are
talking about. I have not seen sequence window oscillations other as the
congestion window oscillates in congestion avoidance as is expected.
