No, that just changes the behavior from "connection refused" to timeout...

I'm actually looking at that case now (4856c84c1358b, but with the fix
above). It seems that the NAT isn't working (DR works, by the way!).
At least the first packet arriving at the real server still has the
client's IP as the source (in the v6 case)...

Let's wait with reverting the local client patches until tomorrow...
maybe I can find the problem until then.
