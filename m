This improves the receiver RTT sampling algorithm so that it tries harder to get
as many RTT samples as possible, using several optimisations.

Applicability and background
----------------------------
The algorithm uses timestamps and differences of the CCval window counter to
guess the RTT, using concepts presented in RFC 4340, 8.1.

There exist 4 cases for the CCVal difference:
 * == 0: less than RTT/4 passed since last packet -- unusable sample;
 *  > 4: (much) more than 1 RTT has passed since last packet -- also unusable;
 * == 4: "perfect" sample (exactly one RTT has passed since last packet);
 * 1..3: sub-optimal sample (between RTT/4 and 3*RTT/4 has passed).

In the last case the algorithm so far tried to optimise by storing away the
candidate and then re-trying next time. This had the following problems:
 * a large number of samples is needed to smooth out the given inaccuracies;
 * the sender may not be sending enough packets to warrant a "next time";
 * hence it is better to use suboptimal samples whenever possible.
As a consequence, the algorithm now stores away the current sample only if the
difference is 0.

A realistic example to illustrate the failure of the (previous) algorithm is MP3
streaming, where packets are sent at a rate of less than one packet per RTT.
Which means that suitable samples may be absent for a very long time.

The effectiveness of using suboptimal samples (with a delta between 1 and 4) was
confirmed by instrumenting the algorithm with counters. The results of two 20
second test runs were:
 * With the old algorithm and a total of 38442 function calls, only 394 of these
   calls resulted in usable RTT samples (about 1%), 378 out of these were
   "perfect" samples, and 28013 (unused) samples had a delta of 1..3.
 * With the new algorithm and a total of 37057 function calls, 1702 usable RTT
   samples were retrieved (about 4.6%), 5 out of these were "perfect" samples.
This means an almost five-fold increase in the number of samples.
