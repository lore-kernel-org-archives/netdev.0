So is it true that every caller of these socket callbacks has adequate
memory barriers between the time the change is made visible and the time
the callback is called?

If so, then there's nothing really specific about nfsd here.

In that case maybe it's the networking code that use some documentation,
if it doesn't already?  (Or maybe common helper functions for this

	if (waitqueue_active(wq))
		wake_up(wq)

pattern?)
