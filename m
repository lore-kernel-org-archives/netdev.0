He :)

Still, I think my original interpretation was correct? It's always
used with constant values and there are many usages similar to this:

skb->protocol = __constant_htons(ETH_P_802_3);

Someone feel free to correct me.

Yep, it's too big, I know :) And reworking the complete patch into a
sane series didn't really work out that well because everything is so
interdependent. Sometimes it might even be easier to look at the
complete, big patch...

Yeah, should be easy. I'll look at it (if there is any interest).
