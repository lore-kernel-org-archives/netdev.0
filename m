Hello!

After some replys I understood that I explained very bad what was my
intention.

I was not complaining that hash size is too low or too high.
I just provided a patch that I found useful: allow easy changing of a
variable at boot time and not to recompile the kernel to change it.

So, I didn't hit the stage when I do some tests to prove that the hash
size is too low/high.

After all you guys explained to me, it is pretty obvious that I will have
bigger problems than the walking of a linked list too deep.

So, I agree, my patch is useless.

Again, sorry for eating your precious time with this!

Thank you very much!
