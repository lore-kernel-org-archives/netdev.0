BTW, the increased latency and the overhead extra wakeups might for some
workloads be greater than the cost of the data copy.

Further, an application might use signals such as SIGALARM,
delaying them significantly will cause trouble.

Which end points would that be? Doesn't this affect a packet socket
with matching filters? A userspace TCP socket that happens to
reside on the same box?  It also seems that at least with a tap device
an skb can get queued in a qdisk, also indefinitely, right?

Or deep copy immediately?
