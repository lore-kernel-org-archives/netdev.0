The problem is that the client has a reference on transport, the transport gets
a socket and the socket holds the net namesace and thus we will not receive the
net->exit event with this approach.

Another option is to break the client's socket reference and kill the rpcb client
on netns stop (i.e. as you propose), but in that case we have another problem - 
how to destroy _other_ clients (not rpc bind ones) when the net namespace stops.

If you prefer either way just let us know, we'll fix the patches.
