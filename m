So lets not do that, the decision was made based on the RX history patch
alone, where, as pointed out, no swapping occurs.

Its is equivalent up to what is in the tree, thank you for point out
that in subsequent patches it will be used.

Had this design decision been made explicit in the changeset comment
that introduces the data structure I wouldn't have tried to reduce the
number of allocations.

And you even said that it was a good decision when first reacting to
this change, which I saw as positive feedback for the RFC I sent.

I pointed two problems one ended up being just the fact that tfrc_ewma
checks if the average is zero for every calculation.

I mentioned in the previous messages, one was a problem, the other you
clarified that was not a problem, but could be optimized.

I commited it under my name because I changed it, while giving you
credit.

I'm sorry you feel so strongly when back and forth you express gratitude
and then you show contempt for my behaviour.

Have you found any problems in it? Look again at the changeset to see if
I "stole" your code as you seem to imply:

    [TFRC]: Migrate TX history to singly-linked lis

    This patch was based on another made by Gerrit Renker, his changelog was:

        ------------------------------------------------------
    The patch set migrates TFRC TX history to a singly-linked list.

    The details are:
     * use of a consistent naming scheme (all TFRC functions now begin
     * with `tfrc_');
     * allocation and cleanup are taken care of internally;
     * provision of a lookup function, which is used by the CCID TX
     * infrastructure
       to determine the time a packet was sent (in turn used for RTT sampling);
     * integration of the new interface with the present use in CCID3.
        ------------------------------------------------------

    Simplifications I did:

    . removing the tfrc_tx_hist_head that had a pointer to the list head and
      another for the slabcache.
    . No need for creating a slabcache for each CCID that wants to use the TFRC
      tx history routines, create a single slabcache when the dccp_tfrc_lib module
      init routine is called.

Is this enough credit? I can make the process slower and simply post
these patches and wait till you review it and incorporate the changes.

You are picking something I did on a RFC patch and exaggerating on your

Again you want to have your patches accepted as-is. Pointed to one case
where I gave you credit while improving on your work (TX history) and
another where the changes were up for review. I don't consider this a
warm welcome for me to finally dedicate time to this effort. Would you
prefer to continue working without help? I think we should encourage
more people to work on DCCP, you seem to think that changes to your work
are not acceptable.

Perhaps others can comment on what is happening and help us find, as you
say, to find a more mature model of collaboration.
