[ Upstream commit c5c7774d7eb4397891edca9ebdf750ba90977a69 ]

In commit 2f94aabd9f6c925d77aecb3ff020f1cc12ed8f86
(refactor sctp_outq_teardown to insure proper re-initalization)
we modified sctp_outq_teardown to use sctp_outq_init to fully re-initalize the
outq structure.  Steve West recently asked me why I removed the q->error = 0
initalization from sctp_outq_teardown.  I did so because I was operating under
the impression that sctp_outq_init would properly initalize that value for us,
but it doesn't.  sctp_outq_init operates under the assumption that the outq
struct is all 0's (as it is when called from sctp_association_init), but using
it in __sctp_outq_teardown violates that assumption. We should do a memset in
sctp_outq_init to ensure that the entire structure is in a known state there
instead.
