First off there are 2 separate issues here:

1) We need to communicate if a port supports or requires various management
   support from the ib_mad, ib_cm, and/or ib_sa modules.

2) We need to communicate how a addresses are formated and resolved for a
   particular port


In general I don't think we need to remove all uses of the Transport
or Link Layer.

Although we may be able to remove most of the transport uses.

Yes OPA is different but it is based on the class version of the individual
MADs not any particular device/port support.

Correction:

  IB SMP  Y  N     Y    (OPA supports the IB NodeInfo query)

How is this different from the SMI?

I somewhat agree except for things like addressing.  In the area of addressing
I think we are likely to need to define something like "cap_addr_ib",
"cap_addr_iboe", "cap_addr_iwarp".  See below for more details.

I disagree.

All we need right now is is cap_qp0.  All devices currently support QP1.

Then after all this is settled I can add:

               IB ROCEE OPA
OPA MAD Space   N  N    Y    Port is OPA MAD space.

Agree.

I think this should be (Y N Y)

IBoE has no SA.  The IBoE code "fabricates" a Path Record it does not need to
interact with the SA.

Given the above why can't we just have the "ib_sa" flag?

OPA does IPoIB so...   (Y N Y)


However, I think checking the link layer is more appropriate here.  It does not
make sense to do IP over IB over Eth.  Even though the IBoE can do the "IB"
protocol.


Making flags in the driver to indicate which ULPs they support is a _bad_
_idea_.

FWIW: I don't consider the MAD and SA (multicast) modules ULPs.   Rather they
are helper modules which are built to share code amongst the drivers to process
things on behalf of the drivers themselves.  As such advertising a need for or
particular support within those modules make sense.

So although strictly speaking we could do IPoIBoEth, I think having IPoIB check
the LL and limiting itself to ports which are IB LL is appropriate.

I agree.  This is the one place we probably want to just keep the "Transport"
check.

While GRH mandatory (for the GMP) is what this is.  The function
ib_init_ah_from_path generically is really handling an "IBoE address" to send
to and therefore we need to force the GRH in the AH.

There is a whole slew of LL and Transport checks which are used to
format/resolve addresses.

Functions which need to know that the address format is "IBoE"

	-- cma.c: cma_acquire_dev
	-- cma.c: cma_modify_qp_rtr
	-- sa_query.c: ib_init_ah_from_path
	-- verbs.c: ib_resolve_eth_l2_attrs

What about a check rdma_port_req_iboe_addr()?

Functions where AF_IB is checked against LL because it does not make sense to
use AF_IB on anything but an IB LL

	-- cma.c: cma_listen_on_dev
	-- cma.c: cma_bind_loopback

These checks should be directly against the LL

Functions where the ARP type is checked against the link layer.

	-- cma.c: cma_acquire_dev
	-- cma.c: cma_bind_loopback

These checks should be directly against the LL

It seems IBoE just hardcodes the pkey to 0xffff.  I don't see it used anywhere.

Function where port requires "real" PKey

	-- cma.c: cma_ib_init_qp_attr

Check rdma_port_req_pkey()?


Over all for the addressing choices:

The "Transport" (or protocol, or whatever) is Verbs.  The Layer below Verbs
(OPA/IB/Eth/TCP) defines how addressing, route, and connection information is
generated, communicated, and used.

As Jason and Doug have been saying sometimes we want to know when that requires
SA interaction or the use of the CM protocol (or neither).  Other times we just
need to know what the Address format or Link Layer is.
