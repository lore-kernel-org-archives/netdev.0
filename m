Forgive me but I'm not very familiar with the process of such changing...

So shall we do this for all the vendors? or provide a transition method
and asking them to do this later by themselves?

The questions is just wondering how the transition method could be, but
if we have to do the changes for vendor, that sounds like a tough job...

I get your point :-) to reassemble the information in old style, maybe
we can temporarily reserve the old mechanism, and do reform for
the user space in another separate patch set, also cleanup the old
stuff too.
