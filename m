Okay, i'll add your sugestion. But i don't know how this would be fixed=
 at all.

Yes, the loss intervals options is mandatory. I'll discuss this too bel=
ow.

Thanks, already corrected in next patch.

Initially I conceived that the receiver would compute the loss event
rate and send it, along with loss intervals and dropped packets
option. And this would enable the sender to just use the loss event
rate reported, as is done currently (in current implementation of
TFRC), or compute it itself, using loss intervals option (in case of
CCID3) and dropped packets option too (CCID4's case).
In my code, I compute the loss event rate using the options, then
compare the two values. I don't know if would be better to keep all
the loss event rate calc only at one side, sender or receiver.

I believe that the first way is better (to "support Loss Intervals and
Dropped Packets alike..."), because RFC requires loss intervals option
to be sent. And so, proceed and implement dropped packets option for
TFRC-SP. You are right, this would need a redesign and rewrite of
sender and receiver code.
