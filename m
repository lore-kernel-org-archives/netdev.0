Well, just FYI at this point, networking is closed for the 2.6.28
merge window.

So all of this stuff will have to wait until 2.6.29 and I'm won't be
creating a net-next-2.6 tree for 2.6.29 for at least a few weeks while
people should be fixing bugs in 2.6.28.

So all of this screwing around caused all of the pending DCCP work to
miss the 2.6.28 merge window.
