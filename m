Hi Jesper, my first thought was flow control, but I can see you have it=
 off.

Can we get some more details on the hardware and bios version?  What
about some dmidecode output.  I'm checking here if we have any
hardware like this.

are you running ubuntu 9.10 or something else?

Wow, thats a monster machine, 8 nodes, 128GB ram.  Can we get a full
lspci -vvv output, as well as ethtool -e eth7 and eth8

32 has ixgbe with a known issue of multiple mappings on transmit
possibly causing some problems, could it be that you're running into
this?  can you apply commit e5a43549f7a58509a91b299a51337d386697b92c
and see if it fixes your issue?
