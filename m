Both variants are starting to sound equally ugly :-)

Let me ask about this situation in another way.

IP input route lookup clients handle this transparently,
even for routes with next-hop exceptions and nocache
routes, by passing the SKB into the lookup function and
there it will sort out whether noref is actually possible.

Is there a reason that IPVS's route lookup architecture
can't work this way too?
