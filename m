The NLA_F_NESTED bit originated in nfnetlink, but was moved
to netlink so the new netlink parsing helpers could also be
used for nfnetlink. It can't be added to existing attributes
since userspace needs to mask it out again to get the real
attribute value and the non-nfnetlink userspace code doesn't
expect it.

Exactly, net/8021q/vlan_netlink.c has two examples of this (the
QoS mapping attributes).
