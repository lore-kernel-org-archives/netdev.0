That does seem very promising but while implementing it
I hit a problem.

struct tcp_skb_cb includes a field of type struct inet6_skb_parm.  And
expanding struct inet6_skb_parm by 16 bytes means that struct tcp_skb_cb is
now larger than 48 bytes and no longer fits in skb->cb.

Is it appropriate to grow skb->cb as the comment above struct tcp_skb_cb
suggests?
