	Similar change in IPv4 opened the Pandora box:
IPVS, xt_TEE, raw.c (IP_HDRINCL). May be the corrsponding
places in IPv6 have the same problem.

	I don't know the IPv6 routing but if we find a way
to keep the desired nexthop in rt6i_gateway and to add
RTF_GATEWAY checks here and there such solution would be more
general. FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH flag can help, if needed.
