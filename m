Ah, CLONE_NEWNS and then you need /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs.  Got it.

I'm kind of surprised that the kernel cares about a specific path under 
/var/lib.  (Seems like policy in the kernel somehow.)  Can't it just 
check the current process's mount list to see if an instance of 
rpc_pipefs is mounted in the current namespace the way lxc looks for 
cgroups?  Or are there potential performance/scalability issues with that?
