Other than the packet format of the sync deamon, are there any
fundamental restrictions here? If we extended the sync daemon,
could it work? If so, perhaps we could rev the sync deamon protocol
and fix a few other kinks, like the handling of timeouts and the
general lack of extendability, at the same time.

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it),
I'm going to be away skiing for the next couple of days. Apologies
for the slow responses that will lead to.
