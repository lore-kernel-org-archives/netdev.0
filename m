| Why not use list_for_each_entry()?
As I recall (and that is now over a year ago), there were reasons for doing
it this way, but at the moment I can not figure out which. It is too
long ago, one of the disadvantages of keeping patches out for so long.

| <first reaction>
| You call dccp_feat_val_destructor on entry->val, that kfrees a field and
| then return it? I havent checked, but would it be safer to set the field
| kfree'ed in dccp_feat_val_destructor to NULL since
| dccp_feat_val_destructor is not a destructor (i.e. its not the last
| function in the life of dccp_feat_val)?
| 
| Humm, and shouldn't this entry be removed from the list?
| </>
Please refer to the comments above the function: 
 | > + *  - each feat_num/is_local combination is unique (old entries are overwritten)
A user is free to call setsocktopt as many times as s/he wants. To avoid
ending up with different values for the same feature in the same list,
there is one a single entry for each {feature, remote|local}
combination. Hence the list is searched first:
	 * if an entry already exists, its entry->val is deallocated
	 * and later filled in new
This is necessary since a user may first allocate {3,2} for a CCID and
then decide to overwrite later with {3}.

If there is no entry yet, a new list entry is kmalloced. Each {feature,	local|remote}
combination is allocated at most once, due to the uniqueness requirement.

|
It seems that the web server (www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gerrit) is still
down, but this discussion would be much easier with the documentation at
hand. But the purpose of the function should be clear from the comments
above it - it is not a "standard" _new routine, due to the specific
requirements of performing feature negotiation safely.

| 
| cool, here you use list_for_each_entry :-)
| 
What is "cool" about it?

| 
| Humm, wouldn't it be better to make the users of dccp_feat_entry_new
| call dccp_feat_list_lookup and if it returns NULL call
| dccp_feat_entry_new that now would just be what its name implies, i.e. a
| constructor, doing just the kmalloc + member init?
| 
This conflicts with the other requirement
 | > + *  - list is sorted in increasing order of feature number (faster lookup)
I agree, the code may look similar, but in feat_entry_new, the purpose
of the list search is to advance to the position within the sorted list
where to put a new feature. When returning NULL, feat_entry_new would
need to start the same search again.

| 
| So dccp_feat_entry will always be embedded on other structs? i.e.
| dccp_feat_entry_destructor doesn't frees its space, only fields that
| points to memory allocated elsewhere
| 
Please note that there is a "val destructor" and an "entry destructor",
whose definition is (from the other patch) below:       

static void dccp_feat_entry_destructor(struct dccp_feat_entry *entry)
{
        if (entry != NULL) {
                dccp_feat_val_destructor(entry->feat_num, &entry->val);
                kfree(entry);
        }
}

So this takes care of freeing the value first and then de-allocating the
list entry.

| Ditto, who frees the struct dccp_feat_entry instances?

Please see above.
