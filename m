Note: removed Ingo from the CC list, I had added it first just because
he advocated reducing the number of mailing lists, so I wanted him to
know that we're trying to do that.

Patches that do one thing that is logically separated from others are
preferred, as its analisys is made faster.

Patches that rewrite an existing functionality are done best when the
functions being replaced keep as much as possible the same name. For
instance, in the new RX handling code we need to alloc the RX hist
internal structures, in the previous implementation we also needed to do
that, it also needs to purge entries, as the old one needed. Previous
one was a linked list, the new one is a ring. As we go we can and should
add new APIs when needed, but trying to keep an API so that if in the
future we decide to rework the internal structures, this can be done in
a plugin fashion, without changing too much its users (CCIDs in this
case), so that we can get back to the old one with minor disruption to
the users if needed. Sometimes we manage to do that, some times we need
to improve upon the current API, but the goal remains the same.

This was for consistency with the other slabs in DCCP:

[acme@doppio net-2.6.25]$ find net/dccp/ -name "*.c" | xargs grep 'struct kmem_cache'
net/dccp/ccids/lib/packet_history.c:static struct kmem_cache *tfrc_tx_hist_slab;
net/dccp/ccids/lib/packet_history.c:static struct kmem_cache *tfrc_rx_hist_slab;
net/dccp/ccids/lib/loss_interval.c:static struct kmem_cache *dccp_li_cachep __read_mostly;
net/dccp/ackvec.c:static struct kmem_cache *dccp_ackvec_slab;
net/dccp/ackvec.c:static struct kmem_cache *dccp_ackvec_record_slab;
net/dccp/ccid.c:        struct kmem_cache *slab;
net/dccp/ccid.c:static void ccid_kmem_cache_destroy(struct kmem_cache *slab)
[acme@doppio net-2.6.25]$

Idea here was to have each C source file to have a init module. Perhaps
we should try to break packet_history.c into tx_packet_history and
rx_packet_history.c. We can do that later to try to meet the goal of
being able to see what is being replaced.

As we did with the ackvecs, will do that later.

I left it to try have the diff not mixing up removal of its
implementation with the implementation of the function just after it,
ccid3_hx_rx_packet_recv. Will remove it later.

As said to you in private message I'll get back to the way you wrote, as
you mentioned that upcoming patches will make good use of that.

I'll try to restrain me to not do too many changes.

See previous comment

I thought about that, but dccp_data_packet is for skbs,
tfrc_rx_hist_entry_data_packet is for tfrc_rx_hist_entries, I guess we
should just make dccp_data_packet receive the packet type and not an
object that has a packet type field.

Idea here is to not expose data structures and functions that are used
only by the rx handling and loss history code.

See previous comment.

I removed that on purpose, it didn't look related to the main goal of
the patch nor was mentioned in the changeset, I'll add it as a separate
patch with the explanation you provided above (and in the past).

will change that later. I.e. these things can be changed later, avoiding
such changes at this point reduces the size of the patch, which is
always good.

We must try as much as possible to not have more than 80 characters per
line, but at the same time the kernel is ever growing, namespacing is
required to be able to use tools such as ctags, and even to help in
decoding oopses I'd say, as we can get more information on a backtrace.

See my previous comment.

See previous comment, we can do that as we did for the ackvec, in a
separate patch, but lets leave this for later now, trying to use
namespacing but with shorter names, that even looking cryptic can help
in searching for RX stamps, for instance, as we will iterate thru them
using the editor search routine and don't get distracted with the TX
tstamps, for instance, or search for them with grep.
