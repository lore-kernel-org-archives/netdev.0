I can't fix this if people don't tell me what the problem is.

Is there some upstream fix and cures this and all I need to do is
sync net-next-2.6 up with Linus's tree?  Is there some external
fix?

It's totally stupid to stall development because of an issue like this
yet give no direction or diagnostics we can use as a path to resolve
it.
