I agree, that would work. Anyway I think it will more invasive than the
proposed code, after the currently ongoing rework. With the above, on
memory pressure, reclaim will be needed on dequeue, and scheduling will
still needed even on enqueue.

The overall behavior of the two approach will be similar: lazy
reclaiming under memory pressure or on sk closing, and rare memory
scheduling.

Any comments are always very appreciated!
