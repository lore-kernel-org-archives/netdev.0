I honestly didn't spend much time at all finding the underlying cause
because it appeared to be fixed upstream: on 3.19-rc5 you get all 3
expected routes after the last step of my repro below. I just really
needed to get this working at the time, and the gross disgusting
horrible ugly awful [more negative adjectives] patch included below made
it work.

FWIW, the explanation I wrote down in my notes was:

"The absence of RTF_NONEXTHOP is causing COWs to happen, which are
always marked as RTF_CACHE. Somehow that's screwing things up in
rt6_do_redirect()"

That could be BS though, I don't at all remember how I came to that
conclusion. 

(/me resolves to write better notes in the future...)

Here's how to get the weird behavior on 3.10 (+stable):

$ sudo ip addr add local 4444::1 dev lo
### Now I have 2 routes in /proc/net/ipv6_route, a local and a non-local
### Both have the RTF_NONEXTHOP flag set (0x00200000)
$ sudo ip route add local 4444::1 dev lo
### Now I have 3 routes in /proc/net/ipv6_route to 4444::1
### Notice the new route does NOT have the RTF_NONEXTHOP flag set
$ sudo ip addr del local 4444::1 dev lo
### Now I just have the one route I created before
$ sudo ip addr add local 4444::1 dev lo
### And now I have 3 routes again
$ sudo ping6 4444::1
[blah blah blah successful ping]
$ sudo ip addr del local 4444::1 dev lo
$ sudo ip addr add local 4444::1 dev lo
### Still have 3 routes
$ sudo ip addr del local 4444::1 dev lo
### Now I just have my one route yet again
### Now, *without the address on lo*, talk to it (it works), then re-add it
$ ping6 4444::1
[blah blah blah successful ping]
$ sudo ip addr add local 4444::1 dev lo
### Now I only have 2 routes... WAT!?
### Notice the LOCAL (0x80000000) route doesn't have the RTF_NONEXTHOP flag set

Thanks,
Calvin
