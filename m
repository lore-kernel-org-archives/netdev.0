No, we could allow one page per socket (udp_mem[0]) and applications
would still work.

TCP has the notion of memory pressure, and behaves roughly the same in
this case (one skb is allowed to be received)

The other (fat) sockets could notice udp_memory_pressure is set and
start reclaiming their forward allocations for other sockets.

We have a counter of UDP sockets, so probably doable to compute
udp_mem[2]/number 

Anyway, just an idea.
