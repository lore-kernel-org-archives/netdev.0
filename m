I thought about this yesterday but did not see an easy way. How does the IPv4
implementation accomplish this?

ipvs caches the dst in its own infrastructure, so we need to be sure we don't
disconnect this dst from the ipv6 routing table, otherwise ip6_dst_check won't
recognize when relookups should be done. Playing games with RTF_GATEWAY seems
dangerous then.

I am currently thinking about using a new flag to replace the nexthop
information with rt6i_dst in these circumstances. The flag would have
to be included in the skb somewhere.

Greetings,
