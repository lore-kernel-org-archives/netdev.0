Dear Gerrit and all,

we have recently submitted to Infocom 2009 a  paper entitled:

"A Mismatch Controller for Implementing Rate-based Transport Protocols"

that is definitely  related with your email. You can find the paper at the url:
http://c3lab.poliba.it/images/0/06/Rmc_ratebased.pdf

Basically we show that a simple feedback loop can  compensate and
counteract uncertainty in timers duration due to clock granularity,
shared Operating System  etc. In this way, the sensitivity to  timer
granularity is greatly reduced.

Please not  that RFC3448 (the TFRC RFC) also provide  a heuristic
(reported as Algorithm 1 in our paper) that anticipate packet sending
times to compensate for delays.

We report the abstract of the work below:
{
End-to-end rate-based congestion control algorithms,
such as TFRC, RAP or ARC, are advocated for audio/video
transport over the Internet instead of window-based protocols.
The reason is that a smoother dynamics of packet sending is
advantageous when avoiding abrupt rate changes is of importance.
Once the sending rate has been computed by a generic rate-based
congestion controller, all algorithms proposed in the literature
schedule packets to be sent spaced at intervals that are equal
to the inverse of the sending rate. In this paper we show that
such an implementation omits to consider a key feature. In fact,
the scheduled sending time of a packet is affected by significant
uncertainty due to the fact that it is handled by the Operating
System, which manages a CPU shared by other processes. A
significant experiment reported in the paper shows that a required
constant sending rate can in practice turn into an effective sending
rate that is as low as one half of the desired one. To overcome this
problem, a Rate Mismatch Controller (RMC) is designed aiming
at counteracting the disturbance on the effective sending time due
to the CPU time-varying load. Experimental results using Linux
OS highlight the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
}

Any comments are very welcome.

Thanks for the attention and best regards,
saverio
