The problem is nfsd. In principle, there's no real reason we have to
register NFSv4 with the portmapper at all. One could envision a
setup where a v4-only server doesn't need to run rpcbind at all. Making
it per-program may hamstring you from doing that later.

It think it would be a good thing to keep it per-version, and it's
trivial to write a routine to do what I've described. svc_creates only
happen rarely.

Just walk the pg_vers array for the program and look at each vs_hidden
value. Return true when you hit one that has vs_hidden unset. Return
false if none do. Then use that return value to replace your new flag
in this patch.
