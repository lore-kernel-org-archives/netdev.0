You should only ever change something like this if you actually
observe a specific performance problem.

This is the part that is driving everybody crazy about your
report.  You seem to be changing this without having observed
a measurable performance problem first, and then tracked it down
specifically to this hash table's size.

You seem to want to change it because it seems to you like that is
what should be done.  You don't really know if it even matters or not
for your workload.
