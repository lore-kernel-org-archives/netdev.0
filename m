A small set of updates, including a bug fix and, by removing redundancies,
reducing the size of the CCID-3/4 socket by a further 18 bytes.  
  
All changes have been uploaded to
	git://eden-feed.erg.abdn.ac.uk/dccp_exp	[dccp,ccid4]
and the `ccid4' subtree has been updated to mirror the changes to CCID-3.	



Patch #1: Removes the ugly history-lookup function tfrc_tx_hist_rtt(), since
          its complex passing of return values triggered ambiguous bug
	  warnings; further subsuming/replacing an earlier test tree patch.
	  The code format is thanks to an earlier suggestion by Arnaldo.

Patch #2: Removes some redundancies (32 lines) in ccid3_hc_tx_parse_options().

Patch #3: Allows ccid_hc_{tx,rx}_parse_options() to check the packet type on
          which options where received, as necessitated by RFC 4340, 10.3.

Patch #4: Finds that the `options_received' sub-struct of ccid3_hc_tx_sock
          is redundant, and removes it altogether. The conversion of received
	  options now happens directly, in ccid3_hc_tx_parse_options().



                  ---------------------------------  
                  ***** Test Tree Update Note *****
                  ---------------------------------
Work on the last patch further helped to fix an omission in an earlier test tree
patch  entitled "[CCID-3]: Remove dead states". The difference below includes:

 * the unnecessary test ("state != NO_FBACK") was removed (the timer
   is first started when changing from NO_SENT => NO_FBACK and from
   then on the state toggles between FBACK and NO_FBACK);

 * the timer is instead disarmed when the socket is no longer in the
   established state: when closing the connection, it is not necessary
   to restart the nofeedback timer -- the connection is in its last
   stages anyway, and the relevant retransmissions of Close or CloseReq
   packets then happen as a matter of course;

 * I think that the following BUG_ON in ccid3_hc_tx_no_feedback_timer(),
	BUG_ON(hctx->p && !hctx->x_calc),
   is now also redundant since, as long as the TX side receives feedback,
   tx_packet_recv is called after tx_parse_options, so that p > 0 leads
   to calling tfrc_calc_x().
