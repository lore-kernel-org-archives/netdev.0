The value of RPCRDMA_MAX_DATA_SEGS appears to have been increased to allow 256KB operations (64 pages). Not all requests will need this, so you may want to consider dynamically allocating the array only when it's relatively large (*nsegs is >8, perhaps).

IIRC, the ib_phys_buf array is only built because it's passed to the FastRegister verb as a parameter. It's not needed by the xprtrdma layer.
