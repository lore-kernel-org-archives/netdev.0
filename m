This comment from Eric, do explain what happens:

"Hans.  
I do know that most outstanding references when you clean up a
container get moved to the loopback device.  So it may not originally
be the loopback device itself where the reference counting is wrong.

I have got some wise words from Eric, 
i.e. moved all ipvs register/unregister from subsys to device 
that solved plenty of my issues
(Thanks Eric)

I'll will post a Patch later on regarding this.

This will not happens in a namespace since nf_unregister_hooks() is not per netns.
We might need a flag but I don't think so, further test will show....
