I was worried that the dev_seq_stop might be called
incorrectly causing an asymetric unlock.  I have no
idea how that might happened, but several crashes
have that dev_seq_stop method listed, so it got me suspicious.

My current code is in some garbage collector timer code, but I can
work on saving the call-site that first pokes the dst into the
garbage collection list...
