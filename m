Thanks Neil.

I've trimmed the cc list to limit the number of copies Trond and Bruce get:)

Briefly looking at the patch, it doesn't seem wrong but I'm surprised 
it's (still) necessary.

Some years ago at SGI we encountered that same problem; we solved it by 
delaying all the allocation of data structures associated with a thread 
so that they were performed in the thread itself, after the thread had 
been limited to run on a certain set of CPUs.  Thus the thread's normal 
allocation behaviour resulted in all of it's allocations being from 
node-local pages.  It was a pretty ugly patch, but it worked and made a 
huge difference to NFS throughput on large NUMA boxes.

Later Jeff Layton converted the sunrpc svc startup code to use kthreads 
and at the time I read his patches, pointed out this problem, and posted 
my patch for comparison

http://linux-nfs.org/pipermail/nfsv4/2008-May/008760.html

I seem to remember coming to the conclusion that Jeff eventually 
addressed this problem...am I misremembering or did something regress?
