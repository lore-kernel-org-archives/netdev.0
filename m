In the earlier trace, the transport socket connection attempt returns EHOSTUNREACH when a socket connect operation is attempted before the interface is up.  In this trace, the network layer allows the transport socket to connect straight away; there's no race with interface initialization.  So your problem is not likely to be in the RPC client, but in the network layer or below (hardware driver, etc).
