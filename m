Thank you for the comments, there is also some update (attached).

| Okay

I revised this some more, the function remains the same, but it is shorter 
http://eden-feed.erg.abdn.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=dccp_exp.git;a=commitdiff;h=94da7d70003e8185fe189146f336db72c8fa1f0b

(If there is disagreement regarding allowing a get_nn_ function to query non-nn
 features, I will add the test for type == NN back in.)

| It's just fine to use dccp_feat_get_nn_next_val() instead. My primary
| reason for creating ccid2_ack_ratio_next() was to keep line lengths

| 
Perhaps a shorter name, e.g.    dccp_feat_nn_get()
(since it returns either the current or next value, and there is no other
 accessor function defined).

| The problem here is that the ack ratio should only be changed after a
| loss, idle period, etc if the new cwnd is going to be less than the
| (negotiating) ack ratio. We need to call dccp_feat_get_nn_next_val() to
| decide whether we need to adjust the ack ratio or not.
|
That is a good point, maybe I need to reread the patch again. From what I saw,
dccp_nn_get_next_val() is so far only called immediately before changing the
value, whereas the above comment hints more at a peek/read-only functionality.

This understanding was also the basis of the attached patch - actually I was
quite happy since its use further simplified the interface.

I think once the above is resolved (which also includes the point below), then
there is quite a good milestone for ccid-2.

| We don't want to change the ack ratio every time we have a loss, etc.

| the ack ratio, neither of which is desirable.
| 
Agree, having done some testing over the weekend I found that some kind of
hysteresis would be desirable.

I don't know if blocking the Ack Ratio code is the reason, but during the
initial slow-start there were ChangeL requests for Sequence Window on nearly
every packet, which seems too much.

If low_threshold == high_threshold, it oscillates. I think you have already done
some work on this in the code using CCID2_WIN_CHANGE_FACTOR.

During steady state of the connection I did not see many ChangeL requests.

dccp ccid-2: use new interface to refactor dynamic negotiation

Using the new function dccp_feat_get_nn_next_val(), this simplifies existing
code to not trigger a new negotiation if the requested new value equals the
old one.
