Hi Julius,

I was looking over this code a bit more closely to rebase someone
elses patch (which I intend to post very soon). I noticed two
minor things.

1) ipl doesn't seem to be needed in ip_vs_out_icmp() any more.
   But actually I'm quite ok with it staying there because the
   patch I was working on will need it.

2) I wonder if iph could be initialised earleir in ip_vs_out_icmp_v6()

Would it be worthwhile rearanging things so that iph is intialised
before "/* reassemble IP fragments */" and used instead
of ipv6_hdr(skb)->nexthdr in the if statement?
