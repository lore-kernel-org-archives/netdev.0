What I am saying above is bogus. As far as I can see, If one callback
request is splitted into two sk_buffs, the function
xs_tcp_read_callback will be called two times with the same rpc_xprt
and the same xid. If between the two calls there is
another call with the same rpc_xprt, but different xid, we consider it
is another callback request from the same server, in
the condition that there is no retransmission in our enviorenment. But
this might not happen because there is only one
callback slot in each server.

I think I have misunderstood the question. Here a static variable can
not be used. Perhaps, we should define a variable for each
rpc_client  (or rpc xprt).
