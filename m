Ok, so now we know how to store information about parameters in kernel
structures. What remains to be discussed is how to pass that information
to userspace.

Now I think that /proc is overly complicated approach.

You can refuse to accept them on sendmsg(). And IMO the application 
should be able to determine which parameters are correct earlier.

The history of software development shows that with newer programming 
languages you can do yourself less and less harm. Think of machine code 
-> assembler -> C -> C++ -> Java/C#. Ok, the last two languages assume 
the programmer is dumb but their success shows that people want 
fool-proof development environments (even if it restricts capabilities). 
In fact they want everything to be fool-proof (from toothbrush to car).

We could make it strong that is enforce that when a parameter was not 
declared it cannot be used.

Yes. But it's only part of the problem. We should also allow 
applications to detect which parameters are ok before calling sendmsg().

The .param field idea only shows how we store that information in 
kernel. It doesn't show how the user can retrieve that information.

I knew we must have been talking different languages ;-)

Ok.

Yes, that's better than what we currently have (and I'll try to 
implement a patch for this).

But this still means that the application that wants to use 
DCCP_SCM_TIMEOUT can get information that it's not supported on calling 
sendmsg(). Which is IMO too late.
