Guys, please, spend some of your expensive time to review this patch-se=
t briefly.
This is not for commit, but just an idea representation.
I really need some opinions about it, since all my further work aroud R=
PC pipefs=20
depends on it.
IOW I need to now, does anyone has something against this idea.
Trond, please, respond, does this idea suits you in general or not?
