Thanks for looking into this.

I think the correct change is to test
		if (atomic_read(&svsk->sk_inuse) > 1 || test_bit(SK_BUSY, &svsk->sk_flags))
or even
		if (atomic_read(&svsk->sk_inuse) != 1 || test_bit(SK_BUSY, &svsk->sk_flags))

sk_inuse contains a bias of '1' until SK_DEAD is set.  So a normal,
active socket will have an inuse count of 1 or more.  If it is exactly
1, then either it is SK_DEAD (in which case there is nothing for this
code to do), or it has no users, in which case it is appropriate to
close the socket if it is old.
Note that this test is for "the socket should not be closed", so we
test if it is *not* 1, or > 1.

The tests are needed because we don't want to close a socket that
might be inuse elsewhere.  The SK_BUSY bit combined with the sk_inuse
count combine to check if the socket is in use at all or not.

You change effectively disabled the test, as sk_inuse is never <= 0
(except when SK_DEAD is set).

This bug has been present since 
commit aaf68cfbf2241d24d46583423f6bff5c47e088b3
Author: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>
Date:   Thu Feb 8 14:20:30 2007 -0800

(i.e. it is my fault).
So it is in 2.6.21 and later and should probably go to .stable for .21
and .22.

Bruce:  for you :-)
---------------------------
Correctly close old nfsd/lockd sockets.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

Commit aaf68cfbf2241d24d46583423f6bff5c47e088b3 added a bias
to sk_inuse, so this test for an unused socket now fails.  So no
sockets gets closed because they are old (they might get closed
if the client closed them).

This bug has existed since 2.6.21-rc1.

Thanks to Wolfgang Walter for finding and reporting the bug.
