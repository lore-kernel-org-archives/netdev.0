No problem at all with incremental patches ;-)

In our experiment, touching udp_memory_allocated is only a part of the
the source of contention, with the biggest source of contention being
the sk_rmem_alloc update - which happens on every dequeue.

We experimented doing fwd alloc of the whole sk_rcvbuf; even in that
scenario we hit relevant contention if sk_rmem_alloc update was done
under the lock, while full sk_rcvbuf forward allocation and
sk_rmem_alloc update outside the spinlock gave very similar performance
to our posted patch.

I think that the next step (after the double lock on dequeue removal)
should be moving sk_rmem_alloc outside the lock: the needed changes for
doing that on top of double lock on dequeue removal are very small
(would add ~10 lines of code).
