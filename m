The abuse is taking place because the marshal/unmarshall is being done 
in-place and it seemed wasteful at the time to add a chunk of memory to 
preserve the aesthetic. A union would 'work', but you still wouldn't 
'know' whether the data was NBO or not by where it was -- which seems like 
the intent of the __beXX in the first place.
