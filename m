I was too optimistic about that one, feeling that it was safe, sorry
about that, will avoid doing that in the future.

Agreed, my bad, will be more patient with my side as you've been with
yours :-)

So we must make it a BUG_ON, not something that is to be always present.

that is ok at this point where we're still going thru lots of patches,
as soon as we collectively agree that it should be a serious bug to pass
a 0 sized packet to this routine, we can turn it into a BUG_ON. But we
must make it from now clear that it is something completely unexpected.

OK, its normal working day, so I'm supposed to be doing "Real Work", so
you'll have plenty of time to look at it before I get back at doing more
serious work on DCCP.

And from what I saw so far that is my impression too, if you look at
what I'm doing it is:

1. go thru the whole patch trying to understand hunk by hunk
2. do consistency changes (add namespace prefixes)
3. reorganize the code to look more like what is already there, we
   both have different backgrounds and tastes about how code should
   be written, so its only normal that if we want to keep the code
   consistent, and I want that, I jump into things I think should be
   "reworded", while trying to keep the algorithm expressed by you.

That is perfectly fine and will give me time to use the regression
testing that you mentioned and also to let me think about further
automatization on regression testing.

Thank you,
