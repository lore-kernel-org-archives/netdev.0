| This is resubmission of queuing policy related patches for DCCP. Queuing 
| policies allow userspace applications to more effectively use DCCP.
Thanks a lot -- all patches applied cleanly. As promised, I have created
a tree "qpolicy" for these patches, which can be checked out via

	# using a recent netdev-2.6 kernel
	git checkout -b qpolicy master
	git pull git://eden-feed.erg.abdn.ac.uk/dccp_exp  qpolicy

I have left your patches unchanged (apart from adapting them to apply
on the most recent base). 

There are four other patches in this repository: I am interested in merging
your patches into the test tree and thus have worked on integrating it.

Rather than sending those new 4 patches individually, I will send the result
(combined with your patch set) as a single RFC patch to the list.

Please have a look at the repository and the subsequent patch -- I would
like to know if you are ok with the changes and/or discuss these.
