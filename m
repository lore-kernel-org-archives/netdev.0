Yeah, I wondered about the same. memset is probably simpler, but direct 
assignment makes it more obvious what is changed. Thinking about it, I'd 
prefer direct assignment, when not setting a complete structure to zero 
and there are not more than a handful lines needed to do it with direct 
assignment. But I'm fine with either way here. If we prefer the memset 
way, we should add a comment to both structures, saying that nobody should 
add anything non-statistic before the member we use to get the size.

Also the estimator and statistics structures can be optimized to avoid 
some padding. I'll include these changes and resend.
