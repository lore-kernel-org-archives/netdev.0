Sorry, but I don't get it. Probably we have misunderstanding here.
You said, that "blkmapd ... tries to open the pipe file when started". =
This pipe=20
file is located on PipeFS, isn't it?
If yes, then PipeFS have to be mounted already in user-space. And if it=
 has been=20
mounted - then pipe dentry is present.
IOW, pipe (without dentry) will be created on module load. Pipe dentry =
will be=20
created right after that (like it was before) if PipeFS was mounted fro=
m=20
user-space. If not - then pipe dentry will be created  on PipeFS (!) mo=
unt (not=20
NFS or pNFS mount) from user-space.

Or I'm missing something in your reply?

The same logic here.

Sorry, but I don't understand, what is your idea. And why do we need to=
 fail at all.
BTW, rpc_get_sb_net() just checks, was PipeFS mounted in passed net, or=
 not. If=20
not - not a problem. Dentries will be created on mount event. If yes, t=
hen it=20
returns locked PipeFS sb and the next step is dentry creation.
