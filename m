Looks like with both patches applied I still also get this eventually:

=====================================
[ BUG: bad unlock balance detected! ]
4.6.0-rc7-next-20160509+ #1264 Not tainted
-------------------------------------
kworker/0:1/18 is trying to release lock (&nfsi->rmdir_sem) at:
[<c03a894c>] nfs_async_unlink_release+0x3c/0xc0
but there are no more locks to release!

               other info that might help us debug this:
2 locks held by kworker/0:1/18:
 #0:  ("nfsiod"){.+.+..}, at: [<c015473c>] process_one_work+0x120/0x6bc
 #1:  ((&task->u.tk_work)#2){+.+...}, at: [<c015473c>] process_one_work+0x120/0x6bc

               stack backtrace:

After the warning, NFSroot keeps working with Eric's patch.
