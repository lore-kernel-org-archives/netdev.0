Ok, I had not realized that the patch that Linus did disabled the warning
for all levels, I'll try to come up a patch to bring it back at W=1 level.

On my system, I had simply reverted the patch that turned off the
warning, but I have now verified that I get it with
"make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wmaybe-uninitialized" on an x86 defconfig with gcc-5 and
gcc-6.

sure, W=3 is useless.

However, I’m not sure the C99 standard would agree that a positive test result implies we can assume that a simple cast of the same pointer to a signed long will result in a negative, non-zero valued errno.

I've looked into this before, as we've had a couple of these cases (I
think less than 10 in the whole kernel, but they keep coming up every
few releases), and I couldn't find a way to make IS_ERR more transparent.

Using IS_ERR_OR_ZERO() seems like a good enough solution, and will
probably result in slightly better code (I have not checked this
specific case though), as we can also skip the second runtime check.
