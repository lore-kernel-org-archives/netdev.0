D'oh.  I noticed the use of time_before() further down in
ip_vs_lblcr_check_expire(), but not the reversed arguments, hence my
confusion.

I still suspect there may be something not quite right, or which could
perhaps do with some tuning.  It's difficult to see exactly how it's
working internally, since there's currently nothing to get a summary of
the dest_sets to userspace.  I'll follow up if I find anything.
