The lblc patch is nearly identical to the last one posted. The lblcr is 
new, but follows the same logic.

They are real races, but are quite unlikely to hit. The lblc and lblcr are 
rarely used schedulers, because they only make sense in fwmark-based 
configurations. The chance of them causing major issues is unlikely, 
because for one you need to catch a destination that is in the trash and 
someone needs to purge it at the same time, which is only possible if that 
someone from user space is moving another destination to the trash and 
then the destination also needs to have all references dropped to be 
purgeable. And the other race is that removing a cache entry races with 
someone accessing that cache entry. For the normal expire time removal it 
means that someone has to access an entry, which hasn't been used for a 
long time. In the end I think it's not urgent to get them in.
