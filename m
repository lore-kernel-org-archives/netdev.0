Eliminating Link Layer is fine if we can do it, but I still think that
something like IPoIB should check the link layer.

After sleeping on it the driver exporting cap_ipoib() does not seem _so_ bad
but I still see a distinction between ULPs like IPoIB and the other modules we
have been discussing.
