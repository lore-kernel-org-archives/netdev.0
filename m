Trond and Bruce, thank you for the comment.  I was able to find the call
to the wait function that was called from nfsd.

sk_stream_wait_connect() and sk_stream_wait_memory() were called from
either do_tcp_sendpages() or tcp_sendmsg() called from within
svc_send().  sk_stream_wait_connect() shouldn't be called at this point,
because the socket has already been used to receive the rpc request.

On the wake_up side, sk_write_space() is called from the following
locations.  The relevant ones seems to be preceded by atomic_sub or a
memory barrier.
+ ksocknal_write_space [drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/klnds/socklnd/socklnd_lib.c:633]
+ atm_pop_raw [net/atm/raw.c:40]
+ sock_setsockopt [net/core/sock.c:740]
+ sock_wfree [net/core/sock.c:1630]
  Preceded by atomic_sub in sock_wfree()
+ ccid3_hc_tx_packet_recv [net/dccp/ccids/ccid3.c:442]
+ do_tcp_sendpages [net/ipv4/tcp.c:1008]
+ tcp_sendmsg [net/ipv4/tcp.c:1300]
+ do_tcp_setsockopt [net/ipv4/tcp.c:2597]
+ tcp_new_space [net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:4885]
  Preceded by smp_mb__after_atomic in tcp_check_space()
+ llc_conn_state_process [net/llc/llc_conn.c:148]
+ pipe_rcv_status [net/phonet/pep.c:312]
+ pipe_do_rcv [net/phonet/pep.c:440]
+ pipe_start_flow_control [net/phonet/pep.c:554]
+ svc_sock_setbufsize [net/sunrpc/svcsock.c:45]

sk_state_change() calls related to TCP/IP were called from the following
places.
+ inet_shutdown [net/ipv4/af_inet.c:825]
  This shouldn't be called when waiting
+ tcp_done [net/ipv4/tcp.c:3078]
  spin_lock*/spin_unlock* is called in lock_timer_base
+ tcp_fin [net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:4031]
  atomic_long_sub is called from sk_memory_allocated_sub called within
  sk_mem_reclaim
+ tcp_finish_connect [net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:5415]
  This shoudn't be called when waiting
+ tcp_rcv_state_process [net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:5807,5880]
  The socket shouldn't be in TCP_SYN_RECV nor TCP_FIN_WAIT1 states when
  waiting

I think the wait queue won't be used for being woken up by
svc_{tcp,udp}_data_ready, because nfsd doesn't read from a socket.

So with the current implementation, it seems there shouldn't be any
problems even if the memory barrier is missing.
