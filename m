It feels like the 'cap_ib_addressing' or whatever we call it captures
this very well. The IPoIB RFC is very much concerned with GID's and
MGID's and broadly requires the IBA addressing
scheme. cap_ib_addressing asserts the port uses that scheme. 

We wouldn't accept patches to IPoIB to add a new addressing scheme
without seeing proper diligence to the standards work.

Looking away from the stadards, using cap_XX seems very sane: We are
building a well defined system of invarients, You can't call into the
sa functions if cap_sa is not set, you can't call into the mcast
functions if cap_mcast is not set, you can't form a AH from IB
GIDs/MGID/LID without cap_ib_addressing.

I makes so much sense for the ULP to directly require the needed cap's
for the kernel APIs it intends to call, or not use the RDMA port at
all.

I liked the OPAv2 hypothetical because it doesn't actually touch the
IPoIB spec. IPoIB spec has little to say about LIDs or LRHs it works
entirely at the GID/MGID/GRH level.
