I like the idea of a query_transport but at the same time would like to see the
use of "transport" reduced.  A reduction in the use of this call could
eliminate most performance concerns.

So can we keep this abstraction if at the end of the series we limit its use?

I think the original code has the bug.

IBoE devices currently return a transport of IB but they probably never get
here because they support the get_link_layer callback used a few lines above.
So this "bug" was probably never hit.

We at least need bits for SA / CM support.

I said previously all device types support QP1  I was wrong...  I forgot about
USNIC devices.  So the full management bit mask is.


RDMA_MGMT_IB_MAD         = 0x00000100,
RDMA_MGMT_QP0            = 0x00000200,
RDMA_MGMT_SA             = 0x00000400,
RDMA_MGMT_CM             = 0x00000800,
RDMA_MGMT_OPA_MAD        = 0x00001000,
RDMA_MGMT_MASK           = 0x000fff00,

With a couple of spares.

The MAD stack is pretty agnostic to the types of MADs passing through it so we
don't really need PM flags etc.

shift for spares...

RDMA_SEPARATE_READ_SGE   = 0x00100000,
RDMA_QUIRKS_MASK         = 0xfff00000

I prefer

rdma_port_link_layer_is_ib
rdma_port_link_layer_is_eth

I'm not sure what this means.

rdma_port_req_iboe_addr seems more appropriate because what we really need to
know is that this device requires an IBoE address format.  (PKey is "fake",
PathRecord is fabricated rather than queried, GRH is required in the AH
conversion.)

Why not call rdma_transport_is_iwarp?

I agree with Jason that this does not adequately describe the functionality we
are looking for.

Right that is why we need a bit for CM vs SA capability.

multicast is part of SA so should be covered by the SA capability.

Right!  So we should have a CM capability.

General management is covered by

RDMA_MGMT_IB_MAD         = 0x00000100,
RDMA_MGMT_QP0            = 0x00000200,
...
RDMA_MGMT_OPA_MAD        = 0x00001000,

Specific management features CM, route resolution (SA), and special Multicast
management requirements (SA) are covered by:

RDMA_MGMT_SA             = 0x00000400,
RDMA_MGMT_CM             = 0x00000800,

Because USNIC apparently does not support MADs at all.  So we end up needing a
"big flag" to turn on/off ib_mad.

RDMA_MGMT_IB_MAD         = 0x00000100,

No this is not the same...  You said:

<quote>
   rdma_port_ib_fabric_mgmt() <- fabric specific management tasks: MAD, SM,
   multicast.  The proper test for this with my bitmap above is a simple
   transport & RDMA_MGMT_IB test.  If will be true for IB and OPA fabrics.
</quote>

But what we are looking for here is "does the port support QP0"  Previously
flagged as "smi".  Cover this with this flag.

RDMA_MGMT_QP0            = 0x00000200,

So the optimized version of the above is:

static inline int cap_ib_smi(struct ib_device *device, u8 port_num)
{
       return [<device> <port>]->flags & RDMA_MGMT_QP0;
}

Agreed.

No this needs to be

rdma_port_requires_sa()

or something...

No this needs to be

rdma_port_requires_sa()

or something...

I would prefer a link layer (or generic) bit mask rather than '&' of
"transport" and "link layer".  That just seems wrong.

I guess rdma_dev_is_iboe is ok.  But it seems like we are keying off the
addresses not necessarily the devices.
