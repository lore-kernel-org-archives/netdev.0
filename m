Hi Gerrit Renker:

I think your should update your patch to avoid compile error:

+#define dccp_feat_print_opt(opt, feat, val, len, mandatory)              \
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+    dccp_pr_debug("%s(%s, ", dccp_feat_oname(opt), dccp_feat_fname(feat));\
+    dccp_feat_printvals(feat, val, len);                      \
+    dccp_pr_debug_cat(") %s\n", mandatory ? "!" : "");
...snip...
+#else    /* ! CONFIG_IP_DCCP_DEBUG */
+#define dccp_feat_print_opt(opt, feat, fval, mandatory)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first dccp_feat_print_opt() take 5 parameters when 
CONFIG_IP_DCCP_DEBUG, but the second one just take 4.
