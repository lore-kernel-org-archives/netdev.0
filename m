Ugh.

If we really have to break it once for IPv6 anyways, it seems like a
good opportunity. Depends on how invasive the changes would need to
be, of course...

You probably already have some ideas on what a better interface would
look like? Especially, how to design it for future backwards
compatibility? And would it still use sockopts or rather one of the
other communication mechanisms?
