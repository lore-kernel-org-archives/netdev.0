The only problem I see is that the source address might get
invalidated (assuming it is a user address mapped into kernel).
Not sure what effect the fault would have...

If it is an RPC retransmittion the NFS write won't be
terminated by the RPC ACK (because it is a stale ACK)
and the destination will see two copies of the NFS write.
(This is quite common with NFS/UDP.)

If it is a TCP retransmittion, then the receiving TCP stack
will see it as duplicate data and discard the contents
without passing them to RPC.

Interrupting an NFS write with a signal is problematic
anyway - I'm sure I've seen systems (SYSV?) when NFS
writes were uninterruptable. NFI how Linux handles this.
