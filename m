Gerrit, the control socket isn't attached to any CCID module, so the
CCID modules should be safe to remove, and IIRC they were safe to
unload.

The unload hack was for something else, for the core DCCP modules. We
can't unload because there are refcounts held by the control sock, so
the unload hack would just destroy the control sock and thus the module
refcount would reach zero and it could then be unloaded.

I've been consistently being sidetracked with work (huh :-)) and
couldn't look at this issue, but the CCID modules should be safe to
unload.
