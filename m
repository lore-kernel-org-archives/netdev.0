The reason I don't like a query is because the transport type isn't
changing.  It's a static device attribute.  The only devices that *can*
change their transport are mlx4 or mlx5 devices, and they tear down and
deregister their current device and bring up a new one when they need to
change transports or link layers.  So, this really isn't something we
should query, this should be part of our static device attributes.
Every other query in the list above is for something that changes.  This
is not.

Sure.  I didn't mean to imply that this was as large is these bit fields
would ever need to be, I just typed it up quickly at the time.

In my quick example, anything that started with rdma_transport* was
testing the high level transport attribute of any given port of any
given device, and anything that started with rdma_port* was testing the
link layer on a specific port of any given device.

TomAto, Tomato...port_is_ib implicity means port_req_iboe_addr.

As per my above statement, rdma_transport* tests were testing the high
level transport type, rdma_port* types were testing link layers.  iWARP
has an Eth link layer, so technically port_is_iwarp makes no sense.  But
since all the other types had a check too, I included port_is_iwarp just
to be complete, and if you are going to ask if a specific port is iwarp
as a link layer, it makes sense to say yes if the transport is iwarp,
not if the link layer is eth.

[ snip lots of stuff that is all correct ]

I kept the name transport, but it's really a device attribute bitmap.
And of all the link layer types, eth is the only one for which IPoIB
makes no sense (even if it's possible to do).  So, as long as the ETH
bit isn't set, we're good to go.  But, calling it
dev->port[port]->attributes instead of transport would make it more
clear what it is.

They're one and the same.  The addresses go with the device, the device
goes with the addresses.  You never have one without the other.  The
name of the check is not really important, just as long as it's clearly
documented.  I get why you link the address variant, because it pops out
all the things that are special about IBoE addressing and calls out that
the issues need to be handled.  However, saying requires_iboe_addr(),
while foreshadowing the work that needs done, doesn't actually document
the work that needs done.  Whether we call is dev_is_iboe() or
requires_iboe_addr(), it would be good if the documentation spelled out
those specific requirements for reference sake.
