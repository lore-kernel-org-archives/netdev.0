That's exactly what I'm thinking ;-)

At first I'm just trying to save us some code but now it's becoming
a topic far above that purpose, I'd like to help commit whatever we already
settled and pass the internal reforming works to experts like you guys
, implement the bitmask stuff ;-)

And I can still help on review and may be testing with mlx4 if later I
got the access.
