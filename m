	This was my first thought but commit 27b75c95f1
(net: avoid RCU for NOCACHE dst) uses dst_hold for
DST_NOCACHE dsts. IPVS wants to cache DST_NOCACHE entries
(due to known-NH reasons) and later to use them for
noref dsts...

	Also, in the IPVS case we can not set skb_dst
at the time when route is looked up because due to
MTU and other checks we can fail, functions like
icmp_send() will need the original skb_dst in
such case.

	There are two choices: __ip_vs_get_out_rt
to return refdst as implemented in this patchset or
to return dst with additional 'bool *noref' argument,
so that caller can decide between skb_dst_set or
skb_set_dst_noref. Then may be we will need just
a new skb_dst_set_noref_{always,force} func that will
contain the old skb_set_dst_noref code, i.e. without
dst_hold? Not sure which variant sounds better.
