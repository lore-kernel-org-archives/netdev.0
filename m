Maybe there is an existing convention here, but: it seems like it would be 
simpler to do something like

 cephroot=<ip[:<port>][,...]>:/[<subdir>]

i.e., the existing syntax used by mount, that (among other things) can 
also include a port, or be a list of mon ips, so that the parsing code 
can be re-used.  Then,

 cephopts=<ceph-opts>

Hopefully this would avoid the parsing in root.c and make things behave 
more consistently with respect to how mount(8) is used?
