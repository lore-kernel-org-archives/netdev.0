Right. It typically does not include DOS on the sender :)

Right. I missed that. I'm guessing drivers don't hang on to skbs
indefinitely.  Still, copying is always safe - maybe the right thing to
do is to add an __skb_queue_tail variant that does not copy, and
gradually convert drivers that care to that API?

For sunrpc yes but I was thinking about utilizing this
mechanism for e.g. kvm in the future. It might be more common
there. I agree this might be a future extension.
