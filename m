Well, it would be a problem if it gets DNATed a second time.
But perhaps we can take a slightly different approach such that
we protect against DNAT while allowing SNAT.


Perhaps it might just be easier to allow iptables to explictly match
packets that have been mangled by LVS-NAT. Perhaps by poviding
a match rule for skb->ipvs_property? Or by using Siim P=F5der's match
against connections in the LVS connection table.
