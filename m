Sorry, I hit "Send" too fast.

This is not implemented for TCP yet.

You'll have to take a look at iproute2 package, since "ss -tp" is able
to find this information, by looking at all /proc/{pid}/fd/*  files and
the socket inode number the kernel gives through inet_diag

Not scalable if you have millions of sockets...
