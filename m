If that's a problem, we can easily change the communication port and even 
completely redesign the protocol this way, without having old kernels 
getting confused about the data they get. We might lose the ability to 
sync between different versions, but in the end this is just the 
connection synchronziation and both systems should be running the same 
version. We could also keep the old communication port for some time, if 
that's really needed.
