Hi Dave,

please find attached part II of the Ack Vector patch set, concluding
the submission (part I) begun last week.

 Patch #1: algorithm to update/clear Ack Vector state in the circular buffer.
 Patch #2: algorithm to register new packets as received in the circular buffer.
 Patch #3: consolidates/updates Ack Vector processing in the main DCCP module.
 Patch #4: schedules DCCP-Sync in case there is no space left for Ack Vectors.
 Patch #5: removes the replaced parts of the old Ack Vector infrastructure.
 Patch #6: Ack Vectors provide information specific to CCIDs; this patch thus
           moves Ack Vector processing from main DCCP into the CCID module(s).
 

I have also placed this in into a fresh (today's) copy of net-next-2.6, on

    git://eden-feed.erg.abdn.ac.uk/net-next-2.6        [subtree 'dccp']

The set is fully bisectable.
