Unfortunately I didn't see any middle ground between one massive patch
munging drivers with lots of different maintainers and one patch per
maintainer (which is loads).

I'll resend in batches of ~20. After the first patch all the "convert to
SKB paged frag API" patches are independent.

Would you be willing to just review patches 1-20 of this series? In
which case I could avoid spamming the list with those again now.

Yes, I noted that in my intro mail and will rebase for v4. Since it's
mostly just been code motion I think review in the old place will still
be largely valid.
