My mistake it was late.  The MAD stack needs to know if it should implement the
IB SMI or the IB & OPA SMI.  That also implies the use of QP0 or vise versa.

In my email to Doug I suggested "OPA MAD" which covers the need to implement
the OPA SMI on that device for MADs which have that class version.

I think all the "users" are either userspace or the drivers themselves.  It is
really just the common SMI processing which needs to be turned on/off.  Again I
think this can be covered with the QP0 flag.

RDMA_MGMT_QP0            = 0x00000200,

Isn't ocrdma an iWarp device?

int ocrdma_process_mad(struct ib_device *ibdev,
                       int process_mad_flags,
                       u8 port_num,
                       struct ib_wc *in_wc,
                       struct ib_grh *in_grh,
                       struct ib_mad *in_mad, struct ib_mad *out_mad)
{
        int status;
        struct ocrdma_dev *dev;

        switch (in_mad->mad_hdr.mgmt_class) {
        case IB_MGMT_CLASS_PERF_MGMT:
                dev = get_ocrdma_dev(ibdev);
                if (!ocrdma_pma_counters(dev, out_mad))
                        status = IB_MAD_RESULT_SUCCESS | IB_MAD_RESULT_REPLY;
                else
                        status = IB_MAD_RESULT_SUCCESS;
                break;
        default:
                status = IB_MAD_RESULT_SUCCESS;
                break;
        }
        return status;
}


Regardless I was wrong.  USNIC devices don't support MADs at all.  So we do
need the "supports MADs at all flag".

RDMA_MGMT_IB_MAD         = 0x00000100,

Which checks are you referring to?  I think there are separate calls to query
the SA when running on IB for both the Route resolution and the Multicast join
operations.  The choice of those calls could be made by a "cap_sa()" helper.

I was not sure how to handle this either...  I guess you need a
cap_multicast()???

I don't think that is appropriate.  You have been advocating that the checks
be clear as to what support we need.  While currently the IPoIB layer does (for
IB and OPA) require an SA I think those checks are only appropriate when it is
attempting an SA query.

The choice to run IPoIB at all is a different matter.

They _can_ use that but the point of this exercise (and additional checks going
forward) is that we don't "hide" meaning like this.

IPoIB should restrict itself to running on IB link layers.  Should additional
link layers be added which IPoIB works on then we add that check.

Seems that way.  But has the rocee v2 been accepted?

Yes opa address == ib addresses.  So there is no need to distinguish them.

Sounds good to me.  But Doug has a point that the address type and the "port"
type go together.  So this could probably be the same call for both of those.
