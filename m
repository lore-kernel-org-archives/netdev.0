I see that (assuming snd_task is always NULL--but, OK, I think I see why
that's true), but we still dereference the xprt after returning from
xprt_release_write().  Only to drop the transport_lock, but I don't see
why there isn't a race.

Yeah, OK, it was just bugging me that I didn't feel like I understood
how XPRT_LOCKED is used.
