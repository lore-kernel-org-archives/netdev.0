Thanks, I very much appreciate the great feedback!

Makes sense, yes!

Nicer naming! I will adopt that.

However, since these container attributes (for daemons, services and
dests) also appear as single elements outside of lists, it might be
better to reuse the same names inside the list?

Yes, the Netlink attribute type should really be NLA_BINARY. I just
used the union as an informal way of saying what I really intended to
store in there, though if some third address family came along, it
could be something completely different.

Ah, looking closer at the validation code, that makes sense.

Hm, I'm not sure if I understand exactly what this struct is supposed
to look like. Could you give an example?

We only need the prefix length for IPv6, for which we reused the
netmask field. This (only slightly) changes the semantics of the field
between address families. Acceptable or better have a separate field
for the prefix length?

Yes, but this count is only returned from commands that do not at the
same time return the list of destinations, so there is no
inconsistency within a message. However, I'm pretty sure the count was
only used in the old interface to allocate enough memory for the
destination list, so it can probably be deleted anyways.

Yes, this field can likely go away too. I was thinking about the fact
that the family of the non-VIP interface of the destination could
theoretically differ, but no support for that is currently planned.

He, that's the thing about IPVS. The current ipvsadm already directly
includes this header from /usr/src/linux/include/net/ip_vs.h to
compile.

So we will have to keep the old header in the wrong location for old
ipvsadm sources and create a new one only for the genetlink interface
under include/linux.

Thank you for spotting all this!
