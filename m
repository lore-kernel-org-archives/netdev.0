I had cause to poke around there recently, and it's *definitely* racy
without BKL.  That file would benefit from several modernisations:

1.  move the list of nfs_unlinkdata from a global to a field in nfs_server

2.  add a lock in nfs_server for it instead of implicit BKL in
    nfs_complete_unlink, nfs_async_unlink, nfs_put_unlinkdata

3.  use proper list.h lists

Yes but it's worth doing, especially serverside.
