This actually provides better coverage since we do this for all the
"positive" test cases, instead of just the single ad hoc case done previously. Of
course the added lines could be factored into a separate helper, but
there's quite a lot of state to pass, so I thought this would actually
be simpler - note how the two string_escape_mem calls are easily seen to
be identical except for the outsize argument.

It may already be too late for the merge window, but I didn't want to
spend too much time on these mostly cosmetic details (that also goes for
the 3- versus 2-line issue).
