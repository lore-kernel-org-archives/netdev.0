David, thank you very much for feedback.

Do you mean that it should be computed based on memory size or you mean
that it should be changeable on-the-fly, even when we have some
connections in the tables already?

Because I really need this now, can we, pretty please, apply it as it is
because is an improvement over what we have now? And, I promise that I
will make it changeable at runtime.
Deal? :)
Or you do not want to have another legacy around?

Do you have some hints (where to look for a similar thing)?
The thing that worries me a little is the locking around the move and
maybe the latency involved. Yes, of course you will not change it several
times per minute, but...

Thank you very much!
