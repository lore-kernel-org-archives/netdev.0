This patch prepares for the new and extended feature-negotiation routines.

The following feature-negotiation data structures are provided:
	* a container for the various (SP or NN) values,
	* symbolic state names to track feature states,
	* an entry struct which holds all current information together,
	* elementary functions to fill in and process these structures.

Entry structs are arranged as FIFO for the following reason: RFC 4340 specifies
that if multiple options of the same type are present, they are processed in the
order of their appearance in the packet; which means that this order needs to be
preserved in the local data structure (the later insertion code also respects
this order).

The struct list_head has been chosen for the following reasons: the most
frequent operations are
 * add new entry at tail (when receiving Change or setting socket options);
 * delete entry (when Confirm has been received);
 * deep copy of entire list (cloning from listening socket onto request socket).

The NN value has been set to 64 bit, which is a currently sufficient upper limit
(Sequence Window feature has 48 bit).

Thanks to Arnaldo, who contributed the streamlined layout of the entry struct.
