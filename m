Unless there is some other mechanism to ensure that all the RCU
callbacks have been invoked before the module exit, there needs to be
code in the module-exit function that does the following:

o	Prevent any new RCU callbacks from being posted.  In other
	words, make sure that no future call_rcu() invocations happen
	from this module -unless- those call_rcu() invocations touch
	only functions and data that outlive this module.

o	Invoke rcu_barrier().

o	Of course, if the module uses call_rcu_sched() instead of
	call_rcu(), then it should invoke rcu_barrier_sched() instead
	of rcu_barrier().  Similarly, if it uses call_rcu_bh() instead
	of call_rcu(), then it should invoke rcu_barrier_bh() instead of
	rcu_barrier().	If the module uses more than one of call_rcu(),
	call_rcu_sched(), and call_rcu_bh(), then it must invoke more than
	one of rcu_barrier(), rcu_barrier_sched(), and rcu_barrier_bh().

What other mechanism could be used?  I cannot think of one that it safe.
For example, a module that tried to count the number of RCU callbacks in
flight would be vulnerable to races as follows:

1.	CPU 0: RCU callback decrements the counter.

2.	CPU 1: module-exit function notices that the counter is zero,
	so removes the module.

3.	CPU 0: attempts to execute the code returning from the RCU
	callback, and dies horribly due to that code no longer being
	in memory.

If there was an easy solution (or even a hard solution) to this problem,
then I do not believe that Nikita Danilov would have asked Dipankar Sarma
for rcu_barrier().  Therefore, I do not expect anyone to be able to come
up with an alternative to rcu_barrier() and friends.  Always happy to
learn something by being proven wrong, of course!!!

So unless someone can show me some other safe mechanism, every unloadable
module that uses call_rcu(), call_rcu_sched(), or call_rcu_bh() must use
rcu_barrier(), rcu_barrier_sched(), and/or rcu_barrier_bh() in its
module-exit function.

							Thanx, Paul
