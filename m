To my knowledge the Linux client has never sent packets that would
trigger the prink above, so off hand it does sound like some sort of
corruption at the network level.

(Independently of that: we should fix the server to support multiple
fragments per record at some point.  But if you hadn't hit that printk,
I'm guessing you would have had a failure soon enough anyway.)

I haven't seen that before.  Adding netdev to the cc:, as you seem to
have reasonable evidence that the problem is the network driver.
