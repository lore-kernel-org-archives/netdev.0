Patch Set looks good except for the very last one ("replace remaining
references to local Sequence Window value"). See below for comments
about that patch.

That makes sense now. Thanks for the explanation. I didn't write the
current code with that in mind. However, it does a good job at avoiding
oscillation most of the time.


Below is the very last patch you added to the test tree. I believe both
of the changes made are not needed. See comments inline.

In this case I believe we want to wait and use the confirmed sequence
window size (like the unmodified code does).

Using the currently negotiating value could result in a congestion
window much larger than the current sequence window (particularly if the
change below is used). This could cause the validity checking code
(dccp_check_seqno) to reject received packets (prior to the confirm) as
sequence invalid. Further, we essentially move back to changing the
effective sequence window before sending the confirm.

Here again, I believe we want to wait and use the confirmed sequence
window size (like the unmodified code does).

Using the currently negotiating value could result in never increasing
the actual sequence window---We ignore confirms for old values so if
begin negotiating a new value before we confirm the previous value we
run the risk of attempting to negotiate a new value several times an
RTT, which results in always receiving (and ignoring) old values.
