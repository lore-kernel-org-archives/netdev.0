Hi, just a couple clarifications and notes.  I haven't deeply thought through 
the new socket options, but disagree with your objections :)

The "intended average packet size", a congestion control parameter used by 
CCID 3 and CCID 4, is different from the actually _observed_ packet size.  I 
could see how an explicit setting for this congestion control parameter might 
be useful in addition to the information communicated by 'len' and incoming 
packet sizes.

CCID 3, for example, says that 's' MAY be calculated from a running average, 
OR from the maximum segment size.  I think an option like 
DCCP_SOCKOPT_TX_PACKET_SIZE, by which the app can declare an intended average 
packet size, is also acceptable.

In practice CCID 2 won't make use of these parameters, and neither will most 
CCID 3 receivers.  But Ian is right that this is a per-half-connection variable.

Don't understand this objection.

This is not right.  We expected CCID 2 and CCID 3 senders to vary their packet 
sizes due to application constraints.  DCCP implementations SHOULD NOT require 
sending apps to limit themselves to a single packet size.  CCID 2 and 3 are 
NOT intended for apps that vary their packet size *in response to congestion*, 
but this is a different kettle of fish.

See above.

This would be fine with me, and perhaps even preferable in terms of the 
programming API.  But the drafts I think would allow the socket option, so if 
it's needed now, why not?
